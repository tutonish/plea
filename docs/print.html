<h1 id="introductory-remarks"><a class="header" href="#introductory-remarks">Introductory Remarks</a></h1>
<p>By Peter Hendrickson</p>
<p>(For fifteen years Professor of Modern Languages in Beloit College.)</p>
<hr />
<p>It is the earnest solicitation of the author to which I have yielded in consenting to write a few introductory remarks to this volume. The consideration that a name more known to fame would serve his purpose better has little weight with the author. His faith in his cause is as boundless as his love for it; and he is content to rest his cause on it's own merits.</p>
<p>It is Gladstone, we believe, who has estimated that in a not very remote future the English language will be spoken by one thousand millions of the human race.</p>
<p>Such a prediction, coming from such a source, may well stir the heart and arouse the pride of everyone who calls the English his mother tongue. Indeed, the unification of the whole human race is a thought prominent in our time. But speculations on this theme, no matter how agreeable they may be, would carry us beyond our purpose, and we must confine ourselves to matters which more nearly concern the present.</p>
<p>A glance at the rapid extension of the area over which the English language has become dominant, leaves no doubt of the greatness of its opportunities. The English may already be called a world-language, as the English-speaking race is a world-winning race. But in the future, its extension will not depend, so much as heretofore, upon conquests or discoveries, nor wholly upon the changing currents of commerce. It must show its inherent fitness to rule, not by its political institutions, or the tonnage of its vessels, but by its power over the minds of men. It must gain its supremacy by the willing consent of the world.</p>
<p>But in order to do this, it must, as it seems to us, make a preliminary conquest which shall restore it to supremacy over itself. What is meant by this, space will not permit us fully to elucidate here. But we may say, briefly, that no one gets willing obedience where he imposes unnecessary burdens. To gain cheerful acceptance, a language should not require to be conquered separately and in succession by all the senses. When it has become familiar to the ear it should not be a stranger to the eye. It should have no masks and no mysteries. It should be friendly to the understanding, and deal kindly with the memory. It should inspire confidence and gain strength by its simplicity and directness. Can any one be blamed for being suspicious of a language whose noblest word, <em>knowledge</em> (nolej), wears a dress twice too large for it?</p>
<p>Truthfulness and practical common sense are marks of the highest enlightenment. But these will condemn a vicious taste which clothes an otherwise common thing with reverence simply because it is unfamiliar. <em>Almight</em> is as vulgar to the perverted taste as <em>omnipotence</em> is to the simple Anglo-Saxon mind. The prime requisite, to gain the respect of others, is to have respect for one's self. We do not respect him who borrows of others when he has abundance of his own. <em>Ken</em> used to be a strong and familiar word to our ancestors. How would <em>star-ken</em> have served for astronomy? or <em>man-ken</em> for anthropology? Our author proposes <em>lore</em>, and would substitute <em>plant-lore</em> for botany. How would a child fare with &quot;<em>nolej of plantlore</em>&quot; for <em>knowledge of Botany</em>? Would it lessen his respect for his mother tongue?</p>
<p>A writer in &quot;Scribner's Magazine,&quot; about fifteen years ago, in speaking of the difficulty the Japanese found in adapting their old forms of speech to the flood of new ideas which suddenly had come upon them, says that &quot;they were talking of adopting ours, but did not like our irregular verbs and arbitrary pronunciation.&quot; Shall we class that among the lost opportunities? The writer adds: &quot;It is a pity that we cannot meet them half way, and give our language a little of that simple euphony which would make its acquisition easier for them as well as our own infant learners. The punitory miracle at Babel has set up barriers all about us. How shall we beat down the wall for our allies in Japan?&quot; Yes; how shall we? This is a question that must be answered, and the sooner the better. It has been delayed long enough.</p>
<p>We are constantly improving everything that we use, except what we use most—our language. Every tool in every trade is made better and more convenient, year by year. But language is a tool we cannot lay aside long enough to have repaired. This is the prime difficulty in the way of language reform. There have been made isolateed attempts for centuries to improve the old, or to invent a new language, and fit it for universal adoption. All have met the same fate, and for the same reason. The changes proposed have been too radical. But in spite of all failures, similar efforts are multiplying, and it seems as if the civilized world were on the eve of some great movement in this direction. It is, as they say, &quot;in the air.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the attempts most recently made in this direction, is Volapuk, which has gained the ear of the world in larger measure than any other, but its race is probably soon run. To attempt to make a special language for a special purpose, like commerce, travel or diplomacy, must, in the nature of the case, be a failure. In travel, in diplomacy, and even in trade, men want to express their thoughts with ease, with grace, with force and freedom. This they will never be able to do with a mechanically constructed language, which is no one's mother tongue, which has no history to make it respected, and no literature to make it loved. A language without a past will be a language without a future. To create a new language for a special convenience is an extravagant folly; and to get away from the language on which a people's mind has fed and grown, and by which its thoughts and feelings have been expressed through generations, is as impossible as to run away from one's shadow. But this does not imply that errors and defects have become sacred because they are in the realm of speech.</p>
<p>Our language is like a tangled forest into which seeds have been wafted by every wind, and which have grown in disordered and bewildering luxuriance. The child is lost in its mazes and labyrinths, and the man is bewildered with its abundance. Instead of this is should be like a royal garden, where nature and art had mutually aided each other; where the grafting knife and pruning hook had been guided by a cunning hand, and where every path leads to some familiar spot, from whence a child could always find its way home.</p>
<p>In a recent editorial discussing the merits of Volapuk, the Chicago Tribune, which has always been friendly to language reform, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the fact that learned men have devoted time to the invention and propagation of a proposed universal language, shows how deep is the realization of its necessity by thinking people, whatever their vernacular; and the main principle kept in mind in the construction of Volapuk, and used with unquestionable advantage by its advocates — its fonetic character — indicates precisely the direction in which some living language must be modified in the process of becoming universal. There is nothing in the history of civilization to encourage the belief that any language, however attractive, can be artificially extended. Conquest, not followed by commerce, cannot do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In closing the same article, the writer says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By fonetic changes, consistent with the genius of the language, sound and spelling can be unified; and in time, as it becomes more and more the universal language, it will fall into an artistic mold in which simplicity will preserve its essence without diminishing its power or impairing its beauty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This expresses, with striking accuracy, the aim of the author of the present work, though it implies a leaving to chance one essential feature of the reform for which the author has sketched the outline of a definite plan. There is not in the history of our language adequate ground for the belief that it &quot;will fall into an artistic mold&quot; if only its &quot;sound and spelling have become unified,&quot; any more than that the forest will of itself become a park. In addition to a simplified, fonetic spelling, the thought and taste of the time need to be directed towards the purification of its vocabulary. There is need of a clearer conviction of the fact that the true economy, as well as the source of power, lies in development from within, rather than accretions from without.</p>
<p>The leading purpose of the author is mental economy. This is to be reached through three main channels. (1) By simple and correct spelling; (2) by a gradual purification of our vocabulary, aiming to enrich our store of words from our own Anglo-Saxon and allied sources, making the words self-developing and self-explaining; and (3) by the largest practical regularity of grammar.</p>
<p>In these changes, however, one thing should not be lost sight of, namely, that no change can be considered practicable, and no reform commendable, which secures any advantage, no matter how desirable, at the expense of symmetry, euphony and force; and this, I think, the author has no where lost sight of, though he has probably in some directions gone farther than most readers will consent to follow.</p>
<p>This is natural. Every reformer must, in the nature of the case, be more or less an <em>iconoclast</em> (this word I have smuggled in, for it has met the author's especial disapproval.) A reformer who does not for a time go ahead of the masses, would have too little force to arouse either sympathy or opposition, and should more properly be classed among politicians than reformers.</p>
<p>The present effort is remarkable, I think, in one essential particular. It is not the dream of an isolated idealist or recluse. It is a growth in the author's mind out of his own needs, and is a voice directly <em>from</em> the people—from that comvination of our population which is characteristic of our great interior. This will be more plain to the reader by a few references to the life of the author.</p>
<p><strong>Elias Molee</strong> was born in Racine County, Wisconsin, in 1854, and is the son of one of the earliest immigrants to that State from Norway. He grew up among American, German, Irish, and Scandinavian neighbors. While the language in the district school which he attended was English, he would daily hear three or four languages spoken on the play-ground. As with so many thousand other children in our land similarly situated, there arose a struggle in his mind and heart between the two rivals, the language of the hearth, his mother's tongue, and the language of the school. The influence of such circumstances upon the mental habit and the character of a child can be understood only by him who has intelligently experienced it. Upon a dull mind, I think this constant strain has an enfeebling effect. It disturbs and disquiets the whole nature. Neither mind nor heart are fully absorbed or at rest any where. Upon the alert and critical mind, it has quite another influence. It arouses curiousity, stimulates observation, exercises the judgment and expands the mind. It acted thus upon the young mind of the author. He became ambitious to learn all these languages. He acquired the English in the school, the Norwegian-Danish at home, but the German was not so easily laid hold of. He therefore, while yet a small lad, gained permission of his father to go to a German who kept a country store on the borders of a German and American settlement, to seek employment. His earnestness, the already acquired master over two languages, and his desire for the language of &quot;das Vaterland&quot; in addition, was just the recommendation that gained favor in the sight of the German storekeeper. From that time to this, one thought has been uppermost in his mind. The spelling of the English language impressed him as a cruelty to the native-born child and more than that to the foreign-born. Wherever he found in any of the other languages some feature in which he thought it excelled the English, he longed to see it appropriated by his adopted language, the English. We are here building up an American nationality out of elements contributed by various nations. It will be a grand nation. Why cannot our language also draw to itself the best features of allied tongues and conquer the world?</p>
<p>Shall the American nation, with its grand opportunities with a future before it like that of no other people, continue its career without an effort to brush off the defects which cling to its speech? Shall this practical, common sense people, that in other things so well understand the value of time, let every generation of its multiplying millions through all ages, waste at least three years of its best time in the often vain effort to learn to spell? Shall the ever-questioning, quickly absorbing mind of the child forever struggle with sounds and words which suggest no thought and bear the likeness of no know image on earth or in heaven, whil the rich treasures of thought and feeling are waiting on all hands to inspire and fructify it? Shall the wealth of exact science, which is the boast and glory of our age, be denied to the multitudes who have neither the time nor the means to spend years in learning dead languages, from whose exhumed relics the jargon is constructed which is called the nomenclature of science? These and similar questions it is which since childhood, have given the author no rest, until after thirty years of quiet picking, gathering and arranging, he has finally rehabilitated an &quot;American&quot; or Teutonic-English language, which is harmonious in its parts, beautiful in its simplicity, pliable in every limb, well sounding to the ear and capable of a growth and self-developement adequate to any measure of intellectual expansion. Such, at least is the hope and faith of its author.</p>
<p>His thirst for a more thorough knowledge of languages early led him to the Norwegian College at Decorah, Iowa, where, besides modern languages, he acquired some knowledge of the classics. From there he went to the American Academy at Albion where he graduated. Later he prosecuted his linguistic studies at the University of Wisconsin, constantly in consultation whith scholars in regard to the one theme about which all his thoughts centered. The gaining of a livelihood has always been a secondary consideration with him, so that, in order that this obtrusive necessity should divert his attention as little as possible, he has in recent years settled down on a farm in Dakota, and thus, hampered with less care, been enabled to complete the preliminary sketch of his work.</p>
<p>Like that of all men who are gifted with the power of concentrating their energies for a life-work upon one theme, so the author's mind has been focused upon this thought till it burns with a steady flame, and is inspired with a faith that will listen to no suggestion of defeat. His enthusiasm is not demonstrative, but it is nevertheless contagious. And though my conviction may in part be due to this contagion, I cannot deny that the system here proposed seems to me, in its essential features, the only conceivable method by which the English language can be restored to a supremacy over itself, and be made entirely worthy of the commanding position which we trust its future destiny may have in store for it.</p>
<p>There is one thought which I would urgently commend to the mind of the unprejudiced reader. This is no scheme gotten up to create a sensation or to gain selfish ends. Whatever judgment the world may pass upon it as a system, let it be assured that this is a work of conscientiuos devotion to a noble purpose. It is a cause to which the author has unreservedly devoted his whole life. He is a native-born, patriotic and loyal citizen of this country, and seeks only its glory and its gain. This work must not be classed with the injudicious attempts to crowd a foreign language into our schools, or as in any way calculatted to detract from our language by emphasizing the superiority of any other. The plan proposed is largely one of mutual concession, but in all essentials the English stands unshaken on its foundation, yielding to no other except where it seems to result in manifest advantage. The plan should arouse no national jealousies; its aim and spirit is to draw all together into a more natural and conscious union.</p>
<p>Ours is a composite nationality, yet largely in a nascent state. The process of welding together the different elements is the real national life now in progress within the borders of these free States. On the surface is the scum of politics and the noice of bread-winning, but below, in the calm, unseen deep, goes on the slow process of absorbing and assimilating into unison the diverse elements of population which gather within our borders. Any apparent harmony, any temporary prosperity, will be evanescent and delusive unless there is constant progress towards a more perfect union of the various elements now contributing materials towards the forming of the ultimate homogeneous <em>American People</em>. The controling and molding Power exerted by the genius and the free institutions of our early settlers is beyond doubt the mightiest influence ever felt in the history of mankind. This power will also in the future be adequate to shape the destinies of our country. But it may not be unreasonable to assume that a gradual simplification of our language in the lines here proposed will facilitate the outer unification and strengthen the consciousness of inner relationship between the representatives of the Teutonic race, of which our population in the main consists.</p>
<p>There are a number of subordinate features connected with the proposed plan of reform to which I am not prepared to assent. The same will, no doubt, be the case with a majority of the readers. Our vocabulary is so largely recruited from the Latin that an attempt at a total expurgation of words of this origin would seem not only futile but enfeebling. A language, as well as any other institution, must bear the traces of its history. This is neither a shame nor a disadvantage. But a too ready sacrifice of its own for that which is alien is a fatal weakness. A return to a healthy measure of self-reliance and self-development, without aiming pedantically to erase all traces of its histoory, will give new clearness and force to our English language. The effort should not be to blot out its history, but to relieve the language of its inherent weaknesses and assumed burdens. No word should be condemned, no matter what its origin, unless a substitute can be found equally as good of purer lineage. But the very principal of historical necessity will of itself in time produce modifications in the direction here suggested. This reform itself springs forth as a new shoot from our historical soil. In some way or other the language of the future American will reveal the elements from which the nationality is compounded. The question here presented is: shall the change be a conscious effort directed by intelligent purpose, or shall it be left to mere chance?</p>
<p>The author does not insist on the minor details of his scheme. He is more conservative than reformers as a class. His system of numerals will probably not meet favor; his alphabet will need improvement; the introduction of new sounds is objectionable. Everything may be regarded as suggestions submitted for intelligent discussion, rejection or approval, except the three main features—a more regular grammar, a freer return to native sources for additions to our vocabulary, and a simple spelling. It is an invitation to the intelligent men and women of our land to join in a conscious effort to make the American language more homogeneous, more pliable, less exacting on the powers of the learner, and more truly an exponent of our history as a composite nationality. Such changes would facilitate its progress and justify its claims to larger dominion.</p>
<p>Its introduction, if favorably received, should not be a revolutionary one. The changes proposed should be set before the minds of the people and the rising generation as an ideal towards which efforts more or less emphatic should be directed, beginning with the reform of spelling, and correcting the taste as regards the use of Anglo-Saxon words. The bondage to a dictionary should be ended, and a larger liberty in the forming out of our own material any word whose meaning would be evident from its parts. The change would be so gradual as to involve no serious inconvenience.</p>
<p>These remarks must, in a measure be apologetic. The author is conscious of defects in the method of presenting his thoughts. His English is at times inaccurate and unclear. For this he craves the reader's indulgence. It is in part due to circumstances which at present could not be controlled. He is a scholar in the field in which he labors; but as he has spent so much time in medittating on what the English language ought to be and might have been, he may be pardoned for not always remembering what it is. But this will not detract materially from the value of his work in the minds of those who are in earnest about an important cause.</p>

<p>The fact that a language is spoken over a great extent of territory or spoken by a great number is no indication of superiority or inferiority as a medium of communication. The Chinese is an inferior language and yet is spoken by the greatest number on account of numerous births and ancient conquests and annexations. From the little country of Spain with only a few millions inhabitants her language spread over Mexico, the West Indian Islands, Phillipine Islands, and all South America, except Brazil. The cause was war and discovery. The little insignificant country of Portugal has succeeded in planting her language in many extensive tracts of territory in Africa and all over the Empire of Brazil, an empire which equals that of the United States in area, excepting Alaska. Again the cause has been war and discovery. The same may be said with regard to the Russian language.</p>
<p>The English owe the possession of the Dominion of Canada to the discovery of foreigners, namely John and Sebastian Cabott, two Florentines, who had resided for some time in England, and who sailed out under the English flag in a north-westerly direction A.D. 1497, discovered Labrador and other parts further south. They brought back as specimens of the products of the country 2 Indians and 3 turkeys. Cheap acquisition! Canada proper was wrung from France by important help from the American colonists. Holland discovered New York in 1609. They commenced settlement in 1613 at New York and later in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. By war and treaty England has taken from the little enterprising Dutch sailor people the following countries: New York (then called New Amsterdam), Australia (then called New Holland), Tasmania (then called Van Diemens Land), and the Cape Colony in Africa. The Dutch, through their diligence and daring, went ahead and discovered, but the the English took it away from them. The English have been hard on the Dutch and on the Irish. That is one cause of the spread of the English language. This tongue got a start in the United States, and those who came here afterwards learned the language as a matter of necessity. In this way the language has obtained a strong foot-hold although only a minor portion of the inhabitants of the United States can trace their ancestors back to English origin.</p>
<p>The spread of the French language is owning not to war nor colonization, but in small degree. Fashion and imitation are potent factors that have been at work here. Louis XIV of France had the most elegant court of Europe. This he could have, being at the head of the richest and most powerful nation at the time. Other courts, dazzled by this splendor, imitatted the French manners and language. Imitation was more powerful and more unreasonable then than now. It was further found necessary to adopt the French as a language of diplomacy and international communication, because it was felt that Frenchmen were unable and unwilling to learn any other languages. This linguistic inability of the French is proverbial in Europe. Even the French Minister at Berlin during 1870-71, at so important a time as the Franco-German war, could not speak German, and was hence less prepared for his calling that a foreign commercial traveler. The French is not a good people's language. Hervert Spencer criticizes it very severly in his &quot;Study of Sociology.&quot; It employs a double nominattive and a double negative, as, &quot;votre frere ou est-il?&quot; and &quot;il n'est pas; a clumsy comparison of adjectives, as, le plus beau for <em>finest</em>. It is very badly spelt, very irregular and, as Prof. G.P. Marsh says, very full of idiotic expressions where words mean something entirely different from what they appear to mean. It has no neuter gender and is very mixed and arbitrary. The language is pronounced with an ill-sounding nasal twang. Rev. Schleyer, author of Volapuk, says French sounds very badly in singing. Yet in spire of all these defects, French became fashionable through the elegance and wealth of the royal courts of France. The common people has never stood very high for intelligence, and never will, because it takes to much time and money for poor children to master the arbitrary spelling and mixed and non-self-explaining words of the French language. The French tongue, as we shall show further on, is only a little better as a means of popular education than the present English.</p>

<h2 id="a-lifting-language"><a class="header" href="#a-lifting-language">A Lifting Language</a></h2>
<p>That a language may lift a people up into knowledge and self-respect on a large scale, it must be self-explaining, pure and homogeneous like the ancient Greek, Irish, modern German and Skandinavian. That is, a good language must be readily understood on a wide variety of subjects with the least resort to dictionaries. It must above all things be expressive and transparent. There is only one way of making the language shuch, and that is to proceed from the <em>known</em> to the <em>unknown</em>; to build from within. Discard borrowing and take to self-development, so that the common words, which all understand, may help to explain and remember the less frequent words. For instance, the Greeks took the following common words to build higher self-explaining ones, as <em>ichthus</em> was the regular common name for fish. Every Greek child knew what <em>ichthus</em> (fish) meant, also that <em>logos</em> meant <em>learning</em> or <em>lore</em>; now, when the wonderfully wise Greeks wanted to give a name to a certain kind of <em>learning</em> or <em>logos</em>, which had for its subject matter <em>fishes</em> or <em>ichthuses</em>, they said with a beautiful simplicity <em>ichthyologia</em>, A.S. <em>fisc-lar</em> (fishlore), German <em>fischlehre</em>, Skandinavian <em>fiskelare</em>, American fish-lore. How expressive and picturesque! How poetical <em>ichthyologia</em> must have been to the ancient Greek man and woman who spoke every day of <em>fish</em> as <em>ichthus</em> and of <em>lore</em> or <em>learning</em> as <em>logos</em> or <em>logia</em>. <em>Ichthyologia</em> was just as expressive to them as <em>shoemaker</em>, <em>schoolhouse</em> and <em>breastbone</em> (sternum) are to our children. What would <em>Plato</em> or <em>Socrates</em> have said if some Greek clown had borrowed the English <em>fishlore</em> or the German <em>fischlehre</em>? They would certainly have said <em>fishlore</em> or <em>fischlehre</em> is not in harmony with our common Greek words. We must build from our own known words, so that our Greek children and laboring men and students of other branches of knowledge can readily understand and remember what they hear spoken on the strangest subjects. We must therefore, fellow-citizens of Greece, develop from our own material and say <em>ichthyologia</em>. How expressive this word is! How full of open spreading vowels to make the word euphonious. The Greeks would never have mounted up high with the English language, for the spirit moves early in a harmonious, thought-aiding and hoomogeneous speech. The Greeks had <em>Demosthenes</em>, the greatest among orators, <em>Homer</em>, the greatest poet. Pope says Homer had the finest ear and he always preferred in his verses open spreadinhg vowels of which the Greek language is so full. Aristotle was one of the greatest philosophers. Even such a scholar as the learned Irishman, Bishop Whateley, is pleased, even to his day, when he can show in his rhetoric and logic agreement with Aristotle. The Greeks were as brave as they were wise. Think of their struggles at <em>Marathon</em>, <em>Thermopylae</em> and Platae! Herodotus was the greatest historian, Euclid the greatest mathematician and Socrates the purest moralist. What enhances our admiration for the Greeks is the fact that they had no other people to copy after or borrow from. They started theatres and wrote comedies and tragedies. Who is not filled with admiration and gratitude at hearing such names as Miltiades, Themistocles, Perikles, Demosthenes, Socrates, Epaminondas, Alexander, Plato, Plutarch, Strabo, Thucydides, Aristophanes, AEschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Herodotus, and Homer? The Roman literature is little more than a copying after the Greeks. The Greeks had a harmonious, self-developed, euphonious, self-explaining language, like the German and Irish. The Germans excel in learning in our time, as the Greeks did of old. No people using a mixed, arbitrary language has got to the front, and never will, because understanding and remembering is made too difficult on a large scale. The ancient sons of the &quot;Emerald Isle&quot; stood very high for learning in olden times, before they forgot so much of their own euphonious and self-developed Irish tongue. People came from all parts of Europe to acquire wisdom and eloquence from Irish scholars. After the Irish tongue had been oppressed by the English law and language, they have gradually sunk in intelligence. This is not to be wondered at. England also stands low with regard to literacy. The Atlantic States in our country have gradually retrograded during the last fifty years and are continuing to go downwards. Even those who do go to school part of the year enough to learn to read easy pieces, understand far less of what they read than those people that are blessed with self-developed and self-explaining home words, as the Germans, Skandinavians and the former Irish. I shall show further on that under equal advantages or adversities the English speaking people will inevtiably fall bvehind as a people in popular education. England and the United States have hitherto enjoyed special advantages. Englad by her extended commerce and foreign colonies has subsisted to a great extent on the sweets of other lands. She has drawn largely on the future by her immense &quot;national debt,&quot; which every one calls an evil to the people at large. The United States have possessed a land that is probably the best country of its extent in the world. Long navigable rivers, abundant timber, plenty of coal, iron, gold, silver and green pastures, and over and above all, a <em>virgin soil</em>, few wars and comparatively small population, and yet the English speaking people stands the <em>lowest</em> among the Germanic nations in literacy. Not because they are less talented, less strong and enduring, but because the English is an unfortunate language. 97 per cent. of the people in Germany, Scandinavia, Holland and Iceland, over ten years old, can read and write, and that is the highest point reached in literacy by any people on the globe. There are always a few cripples or weak persons who cannot be taught. In the northern States where there is found the greatest proportion of foreigners, there is most wealth and intelligence. In the South, where the Old Natives are less mixed by immigration, the white population stands far below the whites of the North. It must also be remembered that the greatest amount of ignorance has come to the United States from English speaking countries, not from Germany, Skandinavia and Holland. English wastes the time of children in mastering the cruel spelling which the majority of laboring people forget in after-life. It wastes the time in memorizing the definitions in school-readers and in searching for the meaning of words through expensive dictionaries. They soon forget the meaning of those arbitrary borrowed words, because they are not ingrafted into the mind in childhood by means of the ever recurring common words. 53 per cent. of English words are taken from all the languages of the world and thrown together in one chaotic mass. The only parallel to this much borrowing are the Turks who have taken half of their words from the Arabian and Persian. They having taken so much from one source makes it more homogeneous and self-explaining than English. There is no honor in borrowing. It is the easiest method possible by which to enrich language.</p>
<p>Mere borrowing requires neither love, learning nor ingenuity. It is only necessary to take without pay what others have made ready. But to so develop our own material, whatever that may be, that our language will vividly express all ideas of ancient or modern times possessed by ourselves and others, with clearness and euphony, that is something which requires love, learning, patience and talent. Then we will have a language that we can call our own, a language we can understand on all subjects, something we can love because it is our own and good to us, something that is kind to our understanding and memory. The impure English cannot be loved as the pure German, Scandinavian and Irish, because English is so unkind, so arbitrary and so much mixed that it belongs in particular to no people. This mixture of languages was forced into England by William the Conqueror after the defeat of the English at the battle of Hasting A.D. 1066. The English speak, therefore, as a conquered people. They speak as they do because they were conquered by the Norman French in 1066. The foreign conquerors learned the most common words of the people, as, father, mother, son, daughter, house, ox, cow, land, stone, etc.; but when they wanted to express higher intellectual ideas, they dragged in their own Norman French words. This accustomed the people to arbitrary-word mixing and soon wore off the feeling of incongruity.</p>
<p>The value of a <em>lifting language</em>, a language that could elevate the masses by self-explaining and thought-quickening words, was probably never thought of or cared for in those days of selfishness, violence and ignorance. I have given you a slight indication of how the ancient Greeks and the modern Germans and Scandinavians develop from within out of their own well-known material, so that even rare words explain themselves. Now let me show you a few Irish words.</p>

<p>Ulrich J. Bourke, President of St Jarlrath's College, Tuam, says of Irish: &quot;It is flexible and harmonious as Greek, soft as Italian, and expressive as German.&quot;</p>
<p>The Most Rev. Daniel O'Connor, Bishop of Slades, aptly says: &quot;Oh! would that our copious, melodious, soul-inspiring, and heart-moving language were received and had become universal! And whyu should it not? SHould it not be our pride and our boast to have such a language, while other countries rejoice in their jargon—in their compound of various languages?&quot; Great many societies are being formed in Ireland to preserve and revive the old language. Holland has its own language with 4 million speakers, Norway 2, Sweden 4.5, Portugal 4. Ireland having about 6 millions, and an island country, could easily have her own language for home use. Scholars must study foreign languages anyhow in all civilized nations. <em>Rev. Bourke</em> says very forcibly in his Irish Grammar: &quot;If we do not cherish the language for its own sake, why, let us do it for our own. We know the language of a nation is the exponent of a people's antiquity, the index of their refinement, the mouth-piece of their history, the type of their freedom, the echo of a nation's greatness and fame—shall we then let our language die?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Bishop O'Connor</em> says: &quot;Are not Scotland and Wales to be admired for their patriotism? and are they not a reproach to us? But why do their languages prevail among them? Because they are used as the common language of the country; because they are taught at school and encouraged by nobility and gentry, instead of being ashamed of their mother tongue—as, I am sorry to say, we are generally found to be of ours—or, rather, are sought to be made so by those who are interested in suppressing it as a mark of our nationality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unless this shame of the language of our ancestors cease to exist and a kindred feeling be cultivated generally, and especially by the middle classes of our countrymen, in vain do you labor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I could take the liberty, I would recommend that in every parish in Ireland there should be an Irish teacher, and that as the ear governs the tongue, it may be familiarized by hearing the language spoken at school, at home and abroad; if it were only thus to employ some poor men and women to speak nothing but Irish in the hearing of children, who, in a short time, would acquire a facility in a common place colloquial way.&quot;</p>
<p>Rev. Bourke says: &quot;Every nation cherishes its own language; it cherishes it even in death. The Greeks loved their language the more, the more it was banished by the Turkish foe. From the ashes of thraldom they have brought it forth—though bearing another name—fresh and youthful as the phoenix rising in its new creative power, after a literary slumber though ages of woe. The Jew in his exile loves, did his captive sires of old, to sing out in his own sweet Hebrew his sorrows in a strange land. And shall the Irishman, in the land of his birth, neglect to cultivate what has been justly called &quot;the language of song—the language of the heart—the sweet mellow language of <em>Eire go bragh</em>?&quot;</p>

<h2 id="injury-of-unsystematic-spelling"><a class="header" href="#injury-of-unsystematic-spelling">Injury of Unsystematic Spelling</a></h2>
<p>English <em>orthography</em> is so bad, so impracticable, that I shall only spend a few words oon this subject for the purpose of filling out the argument. The only true mode of spelling words and the system easiest to learn by children of all nationalities and stations is to have &quot;<em>one letter for one sound, and only one sound for one letter</em>.&quot; Now we begin by telling the child that this short round-like character is called &quot;a&quot; as &quot;a&quot; in <em>ale</em>. The child follows and says &quot;a.&quot; He has now learned the name of that character. But he is soon bewildered; the same letter without any modification is differently pronounced in 1 <em>ale</em>, 2 <em>at</em>, 3 <em>arm</em> and 4 <em>all</em>. Then there are hosts of other combinations that stand for the first sound, other arbitrary combinations that stand for the second, third, fourth or fifth sound. Again the same letter or combination of letters stand at one time for one, and at another time for another sound. There are many letters for one sound, and many sounds for one letter. There is no guiding rule. Mental energy is wasted. Each word becomes a special act of memory, like the Chinese characters. It makes it difficult to learn to read and write. Those who are poor and have but little time to go to school are scared away or cannot master it; hence such spelling must increase ignorance. The wealthier classes who can afford to send their children to school long enough to learn this <em>orthography</em>, wastes so much time in doing so that they cannot learn as much of arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, laws of health, civil government, and music. All must be content with less knowledge and less accomplishments by reason of the irregular spelling. In Germany and Skandinavia no spelling-book is used. There is no need of one, because they spell according to sound. After the letters are learned in their primers, they spell a few words from their reading lessons and copy the reading lessons upon the slates, and as the same letter always has the same sound, children soon get the hang of spelling without waste of time. Spain, Germany and Skandinavia improved their spelling long ago. In American common schools the principal object is to learn to spell. There is no useful knowledge in this early and late spelling, and spelling and spelling. It is as time-wasting and impracticable as the Chinese sign-writing. In both cases does every word necessitate a special act of memory. Both are hindrances to education. Both are degrading. The English are fortunately waking up to see this injury. Ex-Premier Gladstone, the &quot;Society of Arts,&quot; the &quot;Association of Elementary Teachers,&quot; many ministers and editors in England are in favor of phonetic spelling. In the United States and Canada there are a number of journals advocating the system. We have many Professors in Universities and Colleges in its favor, among which I can name such learned scholars as Prof. Francis A. March, of Lafayette College, author of Anglo-Saxon Grammar and Reader; Prof. W.D. Whitney, of Yale College, author of &quot;Language and the Study of Language;&quot; Prof. T.R. Lounsbury, of Yale College. Ben Pitman and the Longley brothers have done much good for the cause by their monthly journals and boooks. Prof. Boyd estimated about 30 years ago that it required English children three years longer to learn to read and write than it did for the children of Germany, Skandinavia and Holland. Major Chas. Sotry, of Chicago, estimates the time wasted to equal from 5 to 7 years, but I have preferred to take the shortest time, three years. It is again estimated by Prof. Boyd and others that it costs the American people $10 extra every year on account of unsystematic spelling. Having about 10 million school-children, and an extra cost of $10 for each child amounts to a loss of 100 million dollars every year for this defect alone! </p>
<p><em>(digitizer's note: adjusting for 2021, there are ~50 million in public school. $10 would be ~$279 adjusting for inflation. This is a loss of ~$14 billion every year.)</em></p>
<p>I said on the title page that the present English was a national misfortune. Let me ask, is it not a national misfortune for the country to lose 100 millions annually and have every person robbed of three years of his or her life on account of spelling? And yet our arbitrary borrowing is of greater damage still, which I shall endeavoor to prove in the next chapter. The loss of time and, what is worse, the loss of useful life-guiding knowledge, occasioned by taking expressions of less frequent ideas from strange tongues not explained by well-known common words as in Greek, German and Irish will probably amount to much more than another 100 millions. But more on this point in the next chapter. The only ones who can learn English spelling are type-setters. No others can learn it. At a school examination in Houston County, Minnesota, in 1876, only two teachers out of 48 could spell correctly the 20 words give as tests. At the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the senior class, the graduating class in January A.D. 1874, handed their Professor of English written essays as required, but only one high-class student of the whole number had spelled each word in his composition correctly, though all had chosen their own subjects and their own words. Having taught English school more than 10 years, I have bene present at a great number of examinations, and I undertake to say that English spelling cannot be learned by the people. Only type-setters and occasionally an old-fashioned school-teacher, who values orthography above all other knowledge, can spell.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott spelt 5 words wrongly in a receipt given for money received as initiation fee to a certain society (spelt by him sosciety) Scott's manuscripts had always to be corrected by the printers. Shakespear has at different times spelt his own name in 128 different ways. Spelling does not show the derivation of words except occasionally. There is no &quot;s,&quot; and no &quot;g,&quot; and no &quot;l&quot; in the old words for <em>island</em>, <em>sovereign</em> and <em>could</em>. Comparative philology is now such that the relationship of words can be traced and proven though the words compared have not a letter in common and differ in meaning as much as black and white. The proper function of spelling is to give a true picture of the spoken language, so that he who <em>sees</em> a word may know how it is <em>pronounced</em>, and he who <em>hears</em> a word may know how it is <em>written</em>. </p>
<p>But even supposing spelling did show derivation of words, which it does not, except in part, it will hardly be demanded by an education-loving people that 999 men should be burdened every day throughout life by signs of derivation which are unreliable and always insufficient, and for which they care nothing, simply that one man out of a thousand may occasionally find it easier to trace some curious word to its ancient source! Max Muller and W.D. Whitney, comparative philologists, say it would have been better for linguists if each age had given them a true picture of their spoken words. Language is above all for the good of the people at large. Dr. Beaty says, we waste enough time in our schools on spelling to give our children a good literary and scientific education. Shall we keep up a mode of spelling, which professional teachers, university students of senior classes and famous authors cannot master? Do you want your children to waste their time on this unscientific and impracticable spelling, or do you want them to acquire useful knowledge? Americanism is to select what is best from other countries and adopt it here. This is a composite nation, a daughter of the whole western and central Europe. This nation is not a daughter of England. The spelling is merely English, but not American in principle. Anything to be American must be eclectic and practical. (See chapter on &quot;Americanism.&quot;) In German there are occassionally a silent &quot;h&quot; for the purpose of lengthening or shortening the sound, as <em>Jahr</em> (year) and <em>Lamm</em> (lamb). Such spelling, however, is not misleading, for it cannot be pronounced differently on account of these extra letters. Their spelling is remarkably systematic and uniform. Even the Germans, who have already done so much for systematic spelling, are discussing the idea of making it still more phonetic. How much more ought not spelling to be discussed among us!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Igh cee a phat chat awn thea chere. Eigh knoh knot whaht thie chait wawnts tu eet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Spelt according to analogy.)</p>
<p>The above is about as strange as the following: <img src="plea/../img/plea1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Prof. Whitney calls our spelling a millstone on the necks of the people.</p>
<p>The Old Natives boast of being practical. Is this <em>orthography</em> practical, or will they help make it so? As all classes are injured by this spelling, all should as best they can in their circle assist to create a public opinion. The best way to do that is to support journals and writers who devote their time to this noble cause wherever they may be found. As Germans and Skandinavians are great linguists, they must keep up their credit for intelligence by taking the side of language improvement, otherwise they will have no influence. It will be said by other Americans: &quot;They can criticize, but they cannot help reform.&quot;</p>
<p>Why could not German, Irish and Skandinavian editors procure $1 or $2 worth of phonetic type and insert a few paragraphs of the Amerikan language in their journals? They may receive no pay for this, but if no one will aid the poor and helpless children, what becomes of patriotism? The Old Natives cannot influence this vast and heterogeneous population alone, even if they were united, which they are not. If we do not all help, we may never see a good language for our grand country. Language reform is as much our business as that of any one else. We have men in all stations of life and in all professions, from the common school teacher to the legislator, editor and university professor, and our men are marching to the front every year. We shall all soon become Americans. No matter how much we may study English, let us not forget the German, Irish and Skandinavian mother tongues. The Jews have clung to their Hebrew language. They say their prayers and chant their joys and sorrows in their ancient tongue, and yet they are the world's greatest business men, as well as the most famous in literature. They are also the least criminal part of our population. They have the greatest regard for old parents and young children, and have the least divorces. Fidelity in one respect produces fidelity in another.</p>

<p>Thinking is classifying previous impressions. We think by means of particular images, or, in other words, we think by means of impression received through the five sense. We have an idea of white, black, eye and fish from having seen it, hard, smooth, soft and rough from having felt it, the different sounds from having heard them, sweet and sour from having tasted it. Thinking is gathering, to remember is to recollect, to gather again. The Latin <em>coagitare</em>, cogitate, is a putting or shaking together in the mind. A general or abstract idea is only a grouping or classification of individual particular impressions. For this reason is it of vital importance that a thing should be named according to the nature of the images necessary to the idea wanted, in such a way that the mind may be carried back and be reminded of the original particular impressions or images that must be gathered to build up the thought.</p>
<p><em>Oculist</em> is a bad word for the reason that it is arbitrary. There is no gathering of images. We understand it only after extra memorizing. He might just as well have been called x, u, or y.</p>
<p>We think only in particulars, as, <em>eye</em> and <em>healer</em> (from heal, to cure), hence <em>eyehealer</em>, Ger. <em>augenarzt</em>, from the particular previous impressions of <em>augen</em> (eyes) and <em>arzt</em> (healer or doctor), Skan. <em>oienlage</em> (eyehealer), from <em>oien</em> (eyes) and <em>lage</em> (healder, curer). The idea underlying this natural self-developing system of producing terms is that each object, not mathematical, shall be named by means of the proper particular images previously acquired in childhood. A double use is hence made of early learned base-words, making them doubly firm in memory. They are first employed to designate the common ideas when needed, as <em>eye</em>, <em>healer</em>, <em>fish</em> and <em>lore</em>; A.S. <em>lar</em>, Ger. <em>lehre</em>, Skand. <em>lare</em>, Eng. <em>lore</em>, <em>learning</em>, <em>science</em>. The same common words, so well and early engrafted in the mind, by the nature of our necessities are secondly <em>gathered</em> to build higher words of which they serve as explainers and remembrancers. Having once obtained an image of <em>eye</em>, <em>healer</em>, <em>fish</em> and <em>lore</em>, such names as <em>eyehealer</em> (oculist) and <em>fishlore</em> (ichthyology); Ger. <em>fischlegre</em>, Skand. <em>fiskelare</em> (science of fishes) become self-explaining.</p>
<p>The Greeks who called a fish <em>ichthus</em>, and lore or learning <em>logia</em>, could with great advantage gather their impression and say <em>ichtyologia</em>. Prof. Schlecher says: &quot;We should <em>see</em> and <em>feel</em> through language.&quot;</p>
<p>There is a deep psychological principle underlying this simple mode of names-giving, which, when understood, will place arbitrary foreign borrowing in a bad light, whatever people resort to it.</p>
<p>What is gained by self-developed words? We gain five very valuable points and lose none.</p>
<ol>
<li>More thoughts understood.</li>
<li>More thoughts remembered.</li>
<li>More thoughts definite.</li>
<li>More thoughts vivid.</li>
<li>More love for the tongue.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="first-pointmore-understanding"><a class="header" href="#first-pointmore-understanding">First Point—<em>More Understanding</em>.</a></h1>
<p>As we think in particular images it is evident that those languages which furnish the hearer with the very images needed to be gathered to build up the thought, as in Greek, German and Irish, are kinder to the understanding than such mixed languages as English, French and Turkish, which give a man not ready prepared thoughts, but mere arbitrary words which he must himself translate into thought the best he can.</p>
<p>A thought is an arrangement or presentation of images, hence, <em>eyehealer</em> and <em>fishlore</em> are thoughts, while <em>oculist</em> and <em>ichthyology</em> are mere symbols of thought to us. We understand such isolated words only by special superadded study, as we learn the meaning of x, y and z in algebra. It may be said that <em>oculist</em> and <em>ichthyology</em> are expressibe to a Latin and Greek scholar. Yes, but that will not help the English language.</p>
<p>We accuse it of being inexpressive to the people at large and wasteful of mental energy. Now, if it is necessary for farmers and businessmen to study Latin in order to understand English, it is all the more true that it is wasteful. <em>Expressiveness</em> is that quality of a word which enables the not-learned in the greatest number of instances to correctly anticipate the meaning. Special study will make any word in any language understood.</p>
<p>A word, in order to be expressibe in a full sense, must carry a mans' mind forward to correct conclusions from images furnished by the word itself. If a boy must look to definitions or the dictionary for the meaning, then the word has not inherent expressiveness. From two to five thousand words constitute an ordinary man's range of vocabulary, but we have about one hundred thousand words in a complete dictionary. The fewer words of a language that are gathered and compounded out of the universally understood common words, as in Greek and German, the smaller will the proportion be of understood words, the narrower must the range of thought become among those who use the language.</p>
<p>There is a constant danger of meeting words not expressive enough to be understood. A man hears and sees words in a hundred circumstances. If he hears a word in a sermon or lecture and does not comprehend it, the value of the whole sentence is lost, and that sentence may be needed to explain what follows. There may be no Latin or Greek scholars near by, to explain to the man and he cannot go home after a dictionary, even if he had one. He might write the word down and hunt up the meaning when he got time. Few will take that trouble. If they did, it would be a waste of time and energy necessitated by the inexpressiveness of our language. In Germany and Skandinavia they use no dictionary in the lower schools. None is needed, because all words above the well-known and ever recurring common ones are compounded from such. They very seldom meet a word of which they cannot gather the meaning.</p>
<p>The tendencies of English are injurious to the intellectual habits of a man. A half understood word occurs to-day, another to-morrow morning, to-morrow evening, next day and so on. The man becomes superficial and will at last shun all difficult reading and confine himself to novels, where there is not much Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>I remember once while in the court house of Houston Co., Minn., 1876, I was given one of Henry Ward Beecher's sermons, and I was pleased with his eloquence. He spoke about marching armies. A Greek word came in that stopped the reading. Beecher said in one place: &quot;The sound of the past has been <em>cacophonous</em>.&quot; Ah! cacophonous. I felt chagrined and humbled to think that after graduating at an American Academy and after having studied so as to speak and enjoy several languages, after having learned considerable Latin and a little Greek, yet I could not understand so popular a production as a sermon. I do not meet words in German or Skandinavian sermons that I do not understand, though I was born in an English speaking country, and have spoken, read and written ten times more English than German or Skandinavian. Is the fault in me or in the heterogeneous character of the language? I will now see how the officers about the court house understood Beecher. I asked the County Auditor, an Indiana man, J. Cooper; the Register of Deeds, an Irishman, James McMahon; the Clerk of the Court, a German, Joseph Vossen; the County Attorney, James O'Brien, who had been a former College Professor. None, except O'Brien, had an idea of what the word meant; he said it was something about sound, but like a wise counselor he looked up the las in the blessed Webster's Dictionary to be sure. &quot;Caco,&quot; said he, &quot;means <em>ill</em> or <em>bad</em>; <em>phonous</em> is <em>sounding</em>. The Greeks put together <em>ill</em> and <em>sounding</em>, <em>illsounding</em>, it is the opposite of <em>euphonious</em>, or <em>well-sounding</em>.&quot; Is that all that the word means? Oh, father Washington! Here I have tramped from office to office among intelligent American officers to find the meaning of a word containing a very common idea; I had expected to find an elephant and found only a mouse. &quot;Hon. O'Brien,&quot; said I, &quot;let us see what the idea is called in the English-German dictionary (Ger. worterbuch, word-book), and let us see how well the German people understand German. We found that <em>caco</em>, <em>ill</em> or <em>bad</em>, is called <em>ubel</em> (evil, bad), sound is <em>laut</em>, something <em>loud</em> that can be heard; <em>cacophonous</em> is <em>ubellautend</em>, <em>ill-sounding</em>. The word is as well understood by Germans as cacophonous was by the Greeks, because they &quot;keep within their base.&quot; The former can also say <em>misslautend</em> and <em>missklingend</em>, and many other self-explaining compounds. When a people once get into the habit of self-compounding, they can produce clear terms, without limit, practically. As Hon. O'Brien and myuself walked to the court house, we asked a twelve years old German boy what <em>ubellautend</em> meant. He answered &quot;vat sound nat goot.&quot; He understood his word, he needed no dictionary. A Skandinavian boy could have told just as easily what is ment by <em>illydende</em> or <em>ilkingende</em>. An Irish boy, with his pure self-explaining tongue, could have done the same. The English are probably the most able people in the world, but they labor with an inexpressive tongue, and outside of physical routine work, their language offers insurmountable disadvantages to a wide understanding.</p>
<p>The English people belong to the Germanic race as well as Germany, Skandinavia, Holland and Iceland. The language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons was German interspersed with Skandinavian words. Here is a specimen from Francis A. March's Anglo-Saxon Reader and Grammar:</p>
<p><em>Ac sprec us after urum andgite</em> (knowledge), <em>dhoet ve moegen understandan dha dhing dhe dhu spricst</em>. (Translated—Oh! speak to us according to our knowledge that we may understand the thing that thou speakest). Again, Matthew XII: 9, 10: <em>Da se Hoeland dhanon for</em> (fared, went) <em>he come in to heora</em> (their) <em>gesamnunge</em> (congregations), <em>dha woes dhoer an man se hoefde forscruncene</em> (forshrunken, withered) <em>hand</em>. <em>And he acsodon</em> (asked) <em>hine, dhus cvedhende: Is hit</em> (it) <em>alyfed</em> (allowed) <em>to hoelanne on reste-dagum</em>?</p>
<p><em>Bird</em> is <em>fugel</em>, <em>eye</em> is <em>eage</em>, <em>conversation</em> is <em>gesproek</em>, <em>boy</em> is <em>cnapa</em>, <em>strange</em> or <em>foreign</em> is <em>fremede</em>, <em>woman</em> is <em>cven</em> (Skand. kvinde). The Anglo-Saxon had a great number of self-explaining prefixes and suffixes, which gave force to the language and the losss of which Prof. G.P. March so much deplores in his &quot;Lecture's on the English Language.&quot;</p>
<p>It is needless to say that no people would ever have taken so many foreign words but after a long foreign oppression. The English language is, therefore, a prominent manifestation of the result of the Norman-French subjugation of England after the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons at Hasting, in 1066. English is not produced naturally by a free people, and it is hardly good enough for our free America, because it is too wasteful of mental energy and cannot be readily understood. Can't we free ourselves from the results of the battle of Hasting, where the English lost the expressiveness of their language?</p>
<p>While at the University of Wisconsin in 1873 and 1874, I saw an account of a school exhibition in a Janesville paper, which stated that a fifteen years old shoolgirl, Hilda Hegg, read an &quot;Essay on <em>Iconoclasts</em>.&quot; Mr. Arnold, son of a Wisconsin lumberman, and Mr. Maxson, son of a Chicago physician, happened to be present. I asked them what <em>iconoclasts</em> meant. Mr. Arnold said he had not heard the word before. He had studied Latin three years and Greek two, but could not understand it. I asked him why he could not understand it after having studied Greek and Latin that much. He said words changed so much in passing from one language to the other, both in form and meaning, that, unless one is an old comparative philologist, he is not always able to trace the relationship, besides there may occur words from Greek and Latin that he has not seen or cannot remember. I told them that, though none of us were Germans, but had studied that language, I thought we could understand it better than our own cosmopolitan English. We found the German word to be <em>bildersturmer</em>, from <em>bilder</em>, pictures, and <em>sturmer</em>, destroyer. Even we understood that, for it was only a <em>gathering</em> of ideas furnished by the word itself. The Greeks did the same. In Greek, <em>eikon</em> is <em>picture</em> or <em>image</em>, <em>klastes</em>, <em>breaker</em>; <em>eikonoklastes</em>, <em>image-breaker</em>, <em>picture-destroyer</em>. The Russians are combining their own common words into higher ones in the same way as the Greeks and Germans. From the word <em>rod</em>, whose fundamental signification is <em>birth</em>, <em>generation</em>, <em>to produce</em>, there is a forest of compounds. A family of words cluster about this central word by means of common well understood prefixes and suffixes for actor, masculine or feminine, diminutive or augmentative, above or below, before and after, etc. The word <em>rod</em> has 25 self-explaining homogeneous primary compounds and 79 transparent secondary compounds.</p>
<p>The Chinese also compound their own material, as,</p>

<p>The Chinese, Russian, German and English will, according to human estimation, be the great languages of the future. They are all possessors of large territories and great numbers of speakers and constantly extending their territories throughout the world. Education and literature is only a matter of time, if they have easily understood languages. 300 years ago, or about Luther's time, the Germans were regarded as ignorant country clowns by the Italians; now they stand intellectually above all nations. The Russians are fast coming to the front. Three of the most prominent writers of our time are Russians, namely, Tolstoi, Turgenieff and Ignatieff. They are beginning to take great interest in education. A certain rich Russian count, whose name I have lost, gave lately the largest sum that was ever given to build and maintain people's schools. The sum given was ten million dollars. Mr. Schischkow, in his treatise on the Russian language, urges the expulsion from the language of all words not of Russian or of Slavonic origin, as they destroy mutual expressiveness. Kopitar, in his Russian grammar, urges the idea of systematizing the language by adopting one regular conjugation for all verbs. (See Kopitar's Russian Grammar, pag. 311)</p>
<p>The Russians have as good chance to build school houses as the Germans, English and Americans. As the English is the most mixed and has the least ready intelligibility, it is safe to predict that under equal conditions the English speaking people will possess the least life-guiding knowledge and finally be looked up to by none of the rest, though they are naturally the most talented.</p>
<p>It is very useful and ennobling for a people to study the handiwork of the Almighty Creator. A rich Englishman cannot learn so much science as a German or Russian in his language, but a common Englishman with moderate means is excluded from the grand book of nature. He cannot understand and remember an article in a newspaper or monthly magazine on science, because his language is too mixed. Ideas plain as day to a German farmer is as the night to an English one, yet they belong to the same race and are equally able. For instance: &quot;<em>Botany is divided into two grand divisions: phanerogamia and cryptogamia.</em>&quot; Here are three arbitrary non-self-explaining words. Botany the German calls <em>plantlore</em>; phanerogamia he calls <em>fruit-bearers</em> or <em>seed-bearers</em> (fruchttragenden); cryptogamia he calls <em>non-fruit-bearers</em> (nicht fruchttragenden), and so on through all the sciences, excepting an extreme scientific idea that seldom comes before the people and for which they have not yet developed their own expression.</p>
<p>In speaking of botany (plantlore), why should we be obliged to say in English <em>glabrous</em>, <em>hirsute</em>, and <em>hispid</em> instead of <em>smooth</em>, <em>shaggy</em> and <em>bristly</em>? Prof. Marsh says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find in a recent scientific journal this sentence: &quot;Begoniaceae, by their anthero-connectival fabric, indicate a close relationship with anonacio-hydrocharideo-mymphaeoid forms, an affinity confirmed by the serpentarioid flexuoso-nodulous stem, the liriodendroid stipules and cissoid and victorioid foliage of a certain Begonia, and if considered hypogenous, would in their triquestrous capsule, alate seed, apetalism and tufted stamination, represent the floral fabric Nepanthes, itself of aristolochioid affinity, while by its pitchered leaves belonging to Sarracenias and Dionaeas.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May God and the Germanic race help the people of America to get rid of this incomprehensible Babylonian jargon! How can common people read science in English? And we must read or take back-seats among the nations.</p>
<p>The learned Professor and U.S. Ex-Minister to a European Court adds: &quot;The nomenclature of science is often so repugnant to the ear, so refractory to the tongue of our Anglican race, that it never finds admission into the dialect of common life.&quot;</p>
<p>It looks to me as if the English language were constructed by some eccentric, rich and learned bachelors who had nothing else to do but hunt up the meaning of words in dictionaries and to spell. It is a remarkable that so busy people should have so time-wasting language. England has had too little sympathy with the middle classes. So unsympathetic a language cannot go on unpunished. The result will be comparative degradation. The United States will not always have a virgin soil, England cannot always live on the sweets of other lands. Germany, Russia and China, with their self-explaining, understanding-helping and memory-helping languages, which they are continually systematizing and enriching, will before long leave us behind with our wheat, corn, hogs, railroads, money bags and incomprehensible words and regard us as Indian princes for our wealth. The world is marching away from the English and Turkish principle of borrowing foreign and unrelated words. A race-feeling is being awakened in all great peoples, which partly manifests itself in language purification. Will it not pay for us Americans also to purify and systematize?</p>
<p>Great interest is being taken in schools and language in Japan. Instead of borrowing scientific words from English, or from Greek and Latin, they compound new terms wanted from the related Chinese language, and I.C. Hepburn, M.D., L.L.D., author of Japanese Grammar and Dictionary, says these words are quite as expressive as those we have developed from Greek and Latin. Nearly all words in Japanese end on a vowel, as in Italian. Dr. Hepburn calls it the beautiful language of Asia. Ex.: <em>Dokoni-i-nasaru?</em> (where do you live?) The grammar is regular and simple.</p>
<p>Under this head of <strong>More Understanding with Self-Development</strong> I shall quote a few of the highest authorities from America, England, Germany and Skandinavia and leave this point.</p>
<p>James Hadley, Professor of the Greek language and literature in Yale College, says in his &quot;Brief History of the English Language,&quot; prefixed to Webster's Unabridged Dictionary under the head of <em>Power of Self-development Lost</em>: &quot;From the simple word to <em>stand</em> the English make <em>understand</em> and <em>withstand</em>; the Anglo-Saxons had <em>atstandan, bestandan, bigstandan, forstandan, forestandan, gestandan, odhstandan, understandan, widhstandan, ymstandan</em>. This deficiency in English is made up for in a measure by the use of separate particles, as, to stand up, to stand off, to stand by, to stand to, etc. Still the formative system of the language has become greatly restricted. It no longer possesses the unlimited power of development from its own resources, which we see in the Anglo-Saxon and in the modern German. If a new word is wanted, instead of producing it from elements already existing in English, we must often go to the Latin or to the Greek and find and fashion there something that will answer the purpose. By this process our language is placed in a dependent position being reduced to supply its need by constant borrowing. But it is a more <em>serious</em> disadvantage that in order to express our ideas we are obliged to translate them into dead languages. The <em>expressiveness</em> of the new term, that which fits it for its purpose, is hidden from those who are unacquainted with the classic tongues; that is, in many cases from the great body of those who are to use it. To them it is a group of arbitrary syllables, and nothing more. The term thus loses its suggestiveness, and the language suffers greatly in its power of quickening and aiding thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Examples of natural and artificial words: <em>eye-healer</em> and <em>oculist</em>, <em>tooth-healer</em> and <em>dentist</em>. A good word must remind us of the required images. John Stuart Mill, in his &quot;System of Logic,&quot; page 431, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must not only be constantly thinking of the phenomena themselves, but we must be constantly looking at them; making ourselves acquainted with the peculiarities of every case.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The algebraic notation, viewed as a philosophical language, is perfect in its adaptation to the subjects for which it is commonly employed, namely those of which the investigations have already been reduced to the ascertainment of a relation between numbers. But admirable as such arbitrary language is for its own purpose, the properties by which it is rendered such are so far from constituting it the model philosophical language in general, that the more nearly the langauge of any other branch of science approaches it, the less fit that language is for its own proper functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On all other subjects, instead of contrivances to prevent our attention from being <em>distracted</em> by thinking of the meaning of our signs, we require contrivances to make it impossible that we should ever lose sight of that meaning, even for an instant.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With this view, as much meaning as possible should be thrown into the formation of the word itself, the aids of derivation and analogy being made available <em>to keep alive a consciousness</em> of all that is signified by it. In this respect those languages have an immense advantage which form their compounds and derivations from <em>native roots</em>, like the German, and not from those of a foreign or a dead language, as is so much the case with English, French and Italian; and the best are those which form compounds and derivatives according to <em>fixed</em> analogies, corresponding to the relations between the ideas to be expressed. All languages do this more or less, but especially among modern European languages; the German, while even that is inferior to the Greek, in which the relation between the meaning and that of its primitive is in general clearly marked by its mode of formation, except in the case of prepositions, which, it must be acknowledged, are often in both languages extremely anomalous.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] But all that can be done by the mode of constructing words to prevent them from degenerating into sounds passing through the mind without any distinct apprehension of what they signify, is far too little for the necessity of the case. Words, however well constructed originally, are always tending, like coins, to have their inscriptions worn off by passing from hand to hand, and the only possible mode of reviving it is to be ever stamping it afresh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can see no danger of compounds losing their original inscriptions if the original words are taken, as <em>eyehealer</em> and <em>shoemaker</em>. If we should wear out <em>eye, healer, shoe</em> or <em>maker</em>, we would have no word for those original ideas. Upon this broad plan compounds must become as strong as the original single words. For this reason prefixes and suffixes should be used as much as possible separately or clearly and <em>regularly derived</em>, to strengthen the linguistic feeling. Much effacement of words might be prevented by compelling an accurate pronunciation of words, which can be done by employing letters for numerical business purposes. (See alphabetic numerals in the grammar.) Mill further adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classification is a contrivance for the best possible ordering of the ideas of objects in our minds, for causing the ideas to accompany or follow one another in such a way as shall give us the greatest command over our knowledge already acquired, and lead most directly to the acquisition of more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Fishlore</em> leads us directly to a knowledge which the borrowed <em>ichthyology</em> does not, because there is no ordering or classifying of previous knowledge. A word should be easy to understand and remember the first time seen.</p>
<p>The best statement of all is the following, in &quot;Mill's System of Logic,&quot; page 441:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A word should be constructed so that a person who knows the thing may receive all the assistance which the name can give in remembering what he knows, while he who knows it not may receive as much knowledge respecting it as the case admits of, by merely being told its name.</p>

<p>The aboce is Greek, German, Irish, Skandinavian, Anglo-Saxon and common-sense doctrine. Ex.: <em>Eyehealer</em>, oculist; <em>birdlore</em>, ornithology; <em>fishlore</em>, ichthyology. What does <em>creche</em> and <em>foyer</em> mean, which I saw lately in an English newspaper? Words must be taken as much as possible from former sense impressions. The great philosopher, Schopenhauer, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Je starker das, was man Geist nennt, um so machtiger auch die Naturgrundlage desselben. Ohne eine starke Sinnlichkeit geibt es keine Genie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another good saying of Mill, of the same import as the sentence quoted, is that words should be &quot;clothed in circumstances,&quot; and that we should &quot;economize the use of names by compounding those we already know from experience.&quot;</p>
<p>My third witness in favor of the Anglo-Saxon and German principle of self-development as against the English principle of borrowing, is G.P. Marsh, in his &quot;Lecture on the English Language,&quot; pp. 206 and 207, where he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>German is singularly homogeneous and consistent in its vocabulary. The essential unity of the speech gives its study immense value, both as a philological and an intellectual discipline, and it has powerfully contrivuted to the eminently national and original character of a literature, which for a century, has done more to widen the sphere of human knowledge, and elevate the habitual range of human thought, than the learning and the intellect of all the world besides.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We express most moral affections, most intellectual functions and attributes, most critical categories and most scientific notions, by words derived from Greek and Latin primitives. Such words do not carry their own definitions with them, and to the mere English student they are purely arbitrary in their signification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The learned American professor says again on page 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The general inferiority of English and French to Skandinavian and Teutonic scholars in philological, and especially etymological research, is a remarkable but indisputable fact, and its explanation is not obvious. I can by no means ascribe the difference to an inherent inaptitude on our part to such subtle investigations, to the delicate relations between allied sounds and allied significations; but I believe the cause to lie much in the different intellectual habits which are formed in early life by the use of the respective languages of these nations. The German is remarkably homogeneous in its character. An immense proportion of its vocabulary consists either of simple primitives, or of words obviously drawn by composition or derivation from radicals still existing in current use as independent vocables. Its grammatical structure is of great regularity, and there are few tongues where the conformity to general rules is so universal, and where <em>isolated, unrelated</em> philological facts are so rare. At the same time there is enough of <em>grammatical inflections</em> to familiarize the native speaker with syuntactical principles imperfectly exemplified in French and English, and a sufficiently complex arrangement of the period to call into constant exercise the logical faculties required for the comprehension and application of the rules of universal grammar. The German language is in itself an intellectual and especially linguistic discipline; it has great advantages over any of the tongues which embody the general literature of Europe. The German boy comes out of the nursery scarcely a worse grammarian, and a far better etymologist, than the ancient Roman, and is already imbued with a philological culture which the Englishman and the Frenchman can only acquire by years of painful study. Hence, we account readily for the comparative excellence of the German dictionaries and other helps to the full knowledge of the language, while in English, having <em>no grammar</em>, we have till lately possessed no grammars, and we still want a dictionary. In both English and French the etymology is foreign, or obscured by great changes of form, the syntax is arbitrary and conventional (so far as those terms can applied to anything in language), the inflections are <em>bald and imperfectly distinguished</em>, and the number of solitary exceptional facts very great.* (See chapter pp, defect 4.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The German philologist, then, begins where the Englishman and the Frenchman leave off—or rather at a point to which the great mass of French and English literary men never attain, and with such an advantage in the starting ground, it would be strange if he did not surpass his rivals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt whatever that the study of the Greek and Latin languages might be advantageously replaced by that of the Anglo-Saxon and primitive English, as instruments of general culture. An overwhelming proportion of the words which make up our daily speech are drawn from Anglo-Saxon roots, and our syntax is as distinctly and as generally to be traced to the same source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The English people have been so long oppressed with foreign words that a hopeless <em>let go as it will</em> has resulted. That there is a greater taste for language among the Germans and Skandinavians is clear from the efforts in those countries to improve, both with regard to spelling and vocabulary. The advantage of a pure language is preached in their universities. Postmaster-General Stephan, in Berlin, forbids foreign terms to be used in the Postal Department. In Sweden, both Karl XI. and Karl XII. forbade the clergy to use foreign words in their sermons. Hence, their languages are getting purer and clearer to the people every year, while English is getting worse, because we have little sense of the inharmonious and incongruous in speech. Adding Romance words to Germanic ones is like patching a black coat with red pieces. Where is the linguistic taste?</p>
<p>I will now quote the highest German and Skandinavian authorities as to the injury to a <em>wide understanding</em> of what is heard or seen in language by foreign or unrelated borrowing. In quoting German and Skandinavian authors, I shall present their language with Roman types. Types are the mere external dress of language, and I agree with those German and Skandinavian scholars who believe in economizing the learning of so many different letters by adopting the cosmopolitan Roman ones, as the English, Swedes and Dutch have already done, and the Germans, Danes and Norwegians partially. All must learn these types anyhow. Volapuk has adopted them. What an obstacle is not specially formed letters in Russian, Irish, Turkish and Hebrew. The Roman is the world's type, and it can't be changed. It would strengthen the Russian, Chinese and German languages in the world to adopt it, because it would enforce less special study on the various readers.</p>
<p>In his preface to the German Dictionary, Jakob Grimm says of <em>language purification</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alle Sprachen, so lange sie gesund sind haben einen Naturtrieb das Fremde von sich abzuhalten und, wo sein Eindrang erfolgte, es wieder auszustossen, wenigstens mit den heimischen Elementen auszugleichen.....Wie der Stolz auf unsere Sprache, der oft noch schlummert, einmal hell erwacht und die Bekanntshaft mit allen Mitteln wachst, welche sie selbst uns darreicht, um noch bezeichnendere und uns angemessenere Ausdrucke zu gewinnen, wird auch die Anwendung des Fremden weichen und beschrankt werden.....Man darf uberhaupt nicht vergessen, dass es keineswegs die Mitte des Volks ist, die das Fremde in unserer Sprache heranschwemmte, vielmehr dass es ihr zugefuhrt wurde durch die dem auslandischen Brauch huldigenden Furstenhofe, durch den steifen und undeutschen Stil der Behorden, durch Kanzeleien und Gerichte, sowie durch das Bestreben aller Wissenschaften, ihre Kunstausdrucke den fremden zu bequemen oder diesen den Rang vor jedem eigenen Wort zu lassen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sanders says in his Dictionary of Foreign Words, as given by &quot;Meyer's Konversations Lexicon&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wem das Gefuhl fur Einheit und Reinheit der Sprache nicht ganz abhanden gekommen ist, dessen Ohr muss durch die Einmischung des Fremdartigen, auch wenn er den Sinn vollkommen versteht, empfindlich verletzt werden. Dazu ist fur die (fremder Sprachen unkundige) grosse Masse des Volks zugleich alles Undeutsche auch etwas Undeutliches, Unverstandenes und Unverstandliches, und so entsteht durch die Einmischung des Fremdartigen nicht blos eine das feinere Sprachgefuhl beleidigende Ungleichartigkeit und Buntscheckigkeit, sondern auch geradezu ein die Volksverstandlichkeit schwer beeintrachtigendes Kauderwalsch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goethe says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Muttersprache zugleich reinigen und bereichern ist das Geschaft der besten Kopfe; Reiningen ohne Bereicherung erweist sich ofters geistlos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prof. Sanders futher says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nicht dringend genug freilich kann das Streben nach moglichster Reinheit des Ausdrucks empfohlen werden; nicht heiss genug gebrandmarkt die Verunreiningung unserer Sprache.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best part of a language is the transparent harmony that subsists between its words. This harmony cannot be borrowed, hence we do not get the best part of foreign languages by borrowing. The Danish writer, Holberg, says, in one of his plays, that the devil was once upon earth to bewilder men. He therefore gave each people a separate language, so they could not understand each other; but England being on an Island by itself, he forgot that country. The English cried, because they had no language. The devil took pity on them, and boiled together a soup of the scum from all other languages, and called it English.</p>
<p>Rev. Father Bourke calls English a <em>barbarous jargon</em>, and a compound of all languages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The famous Skandinavian scientist in electricity and magnetism, Hans Christian Oersted, says: &quot;Altfor ofte have vi optaget fremmede Ord med Tilsidesaettelse af vor egen Sprogskat, ofte have vi ligefrem oversat Fremmedes sammensatte Ord, uagtet vi erholdt Udtryk, som ikke passe til Sprogets Natur. Vore Skribenter ere neppe virksomme nok til at modarbeide de Misbrug, de fleste indfore. Man har sorget for det moderne latinske Sprog ved at gjore en Ordbog over de af de nyere Skribenter hyppigst begaaede Feil. Vort Sprog kunde traenge til en saadan Antibarbarus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the great Danish Historian, Poet and Divine N.F.S. Grundtvig:</p>
<pre><code>Modersmaal er det Rosenbaand,
Som Store og Smaa omslunger;
I det lever kun Faedres Aand,
Og deri kun Hjertet gynger.

Modersmaal er vort Hjertesprog,

<p>I now quote from a &quot;History of the Swedish Language and Literature,&quot; by Gustaf Klaeson, 4th Edition. I call the attention of the reader to the many open and final vowels of this language. All vowels are separately pronounced. He speaks of the great advantage to the people of using self-developing words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Betrakta vi ordforadet i denna tids literatur (1640-1730), mota vi en oerhord forbistring. Redan under foregaende tidehvarfvet upptogos manga ofverflodiga ord i spraket, och detta missbruk, som framfor allt traffas i offentliga handlingar och hos forfattare tillhorande de fornama familjerna, grep under forra halften af detta tidehvarhvet allt mer omkring sig. Derigenom fick skrifspraket ett verkligen afskrackande utseende. Ganska fa voro de forfattare under denna tid, hvilka skrefvo ett sprak, som me ratt kunde kallas <em>svenska</em>. De fleste vanstalde modersmalet genom ett brokigt pahang af latinska och franska uttryck och ordformer, hvarigenom dess anborna manlighet, adelhet och behag helt och hallet utplanades eller bortskymdes. Jemfor man nagon af dessa skrifter med reformatorernes fran foregaende tidehvarf, hapnar man ovilkorligt ofver det forfall, som 1600-talets skrifsprak foreter. Det ar ingenting ovanligt att der traffa sadana franstotande uttryck som t. ex. dessa: <em>jag kommer att extendera mig pa subjectet af den person; mitt humeur ar icke porterat att ingerera mig i den saken; jag promitterar mig att varda protegerat</em>, o. dyl. Flera fosterlandskt sinnade man upptradde mot denna sprakforbistring. *Spegel, Svedberg, Lindschold o. a. ifrade afven mot de frammande ordens otidiga anvandande. Den nya kyrkolagen inskarpte hos presterskapet vigten af ett rent sprak, i tva bref till hofraterna forbjod Karl XI. dessa att inblanda utlandska ord i spraket, och i sin kansliordning pabjod Karl XII. bruket af ren svenska och undvikandet af frammande ord. Antalet af svenska skrifter tillvaxte betydligt under detta tidskifte.</p>

<h1 id="more-thoughts-remembered-with-self-development"><a class="header" href="#more-thoughts-remembered-with-self-development">More Thoughts Remembered with Self-Development</a></h1>
<p>We know, from the study of mental philosophy, that memory depends upon certain laws. The most prominent of these laws that concern us now are understanding, repetition, vividness, likeness and unlikeness. That is, we remember longer what we understand than what is imperfectly understood. <em>Oculist</em> and <em>ichthyology</em> are not understood the first time they are seen. Hence easy to forget, while <em>eyehealer</em> and <em>fishlore</em> would be easy to remember, especially after being used to this mode of compounding.</p>
<p>Repetition and time are necessary to ingraft words into the mind. When we say <em>eyehealer</em> instead of <em>oculist</em>, we take advantage of words which repetition and time have already ingrafted, and are not obliged to ingraft a new extra term, hence less burden on memory. This mode of composition is alike in all cases a mere juxtaposition of images. Two things joined are easier to remember than one isolated fact. Again, <em>eyehealer</em> is more picturesque, hence it is more vivid. <em>Eyehealer</em> brings nature fully before the mind's eye, and this facilitates memory. Likeness and unlikeness are not only great memory-strengtheners, but the foundation of all reasoning. When objects are named from something they are like or unlike, as they often must be in a self-developing language, this will also facilitate memory. Examples: <em>sword-shaped</em> instead of <em>ensiform</em>; <em>unnatural</em>, not like <em>nature</em>. If the same negative particle is always used, it facilitates both understanding and memory; hence, <em>uncorrect</em> instead of <em>incorrect</em>.</p>
<p>Civilization is getting so complex, there are so many things to be remembered, that it will really become necessary to economize the number of independent isolated words by compounding into self-explaining ones those we know, and that will of course help memory.</p>
<h1 id="more-thoughts-definite-with-self-development"><a class="header" href="#more-thoughts-definite-with-self-development">More Thoughts Definite with Self-Development</a></h1>
<p><em>Phenogamia</em> is a Greek word referring to those plants that bear <em>fruit</em> or that bear <em>seed</em>, we cannot tell which. The Germans or Skandinavians would say fruitbearing or seedbearing, according to the particular idea wanted. If they desired to express any other thought, they could easily manufacture a new word in a minute, whether in the dictionary or not. Each word would be easy to understand and remember and be <em>definite</em>. The foreign borrowed word being difficult to master, there is a reluctance to borrow any more expressions than is absolutely necessary, hence we must often content ourselves with the same expression for several distinct ideas. Take, for instance, <em>anatomy</em> and <em>ascend</em>. Anatomy is called by the Germans either <em>Zergliederungskunt</em> (that is dismembering art or unlimbing art,) or it is called <em>Zergliederungswissenschaft</em> (that is dismembering science), according as they wish to emphasize it as an art or science. The word is long, but this is necessary to make it so descriptive that students of other branches of knowledge, as well as the people at large, can understand as much as possible of what is read, and it is long that it may be <em>definite</em>. We say <em>ascend</em> in English, which is a very general and indefinite word, but as we have the word, there is a temptation to use it. The German who loves to be definite and exact, will use a word expressing the mode of ascending, as <em>aufgehen, aufsegeln, auffahern, aufreiten, auflaufen</em>, etc., that is <em>upgo, upsail, upfare, upride, uprun</em>. Not any of these definite, self-explaining home-compounds take any more syllables than <em>ascend</em>. When a langauge is correctly constructed, it is just as easy to speak definitely as generically, and in the long run, it gives a man more solid knowledge.</p>
<p>Self-development makes words better understood, longer remembered and more definite.</p>
<h1 id="more-things-vivid-with-self-development"><a class="header" href="#more-things-vivid-with-self-development">More Things Vivid with Self-Development</a></h1>
<p>Vividness is that quality of a word which brings the things spoken of before the mind's eye with clearness, ease and lifelikeness. But in order that a word may do that it must appeal to the mind's old associates and impressions; it must <em>gather</em> for the hearer such particular images as he is acquainted with, and as he needs to build up the thought. <em>Oculist</em> is arbitrary, it appeals to nothing, gathers nothing. Thinking is gathering impressions. Therefore an arbitrary foreign word cannot be vivid. A mentally economical word is one that furnishes in itself the images out of which to construct the thought. Herbert Spencer says in his &quot;Philosophy of Style:&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we do not think in generals but in particulars—as, whenever any class of things is referred to, we represent it to ourselves by calling to mind individual members of it—it follows that when an abstract word is used the hearer or reader has to choose from his stock of images, one or more, by which he may figure to himself the genus mentioned. In doing this some delay must arise, some force be expended; and if, by emplying a specific term an <em>appropriate image</em> can be at once suggested, an economy is achieved, and a more vivid impression produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By compounding the common words, we make language more figurative and picturesque. Prof. Marsh says, Lect. Eng. Lang., p. 200:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our present power of derivation and composition is much restricted, and while many other languages can change all nouns, substantives and adjectives into each other or into verbs, and <em>vice versa</em>, still retaining the <em>root form</em>, which makes the new-coined word at once understood by every native ear, we, on the contrary, are constantly obliged to resort to compounds of foreign, and to us, unmeaning roots, whenever we wish to express a complex idea by a single word. The German and other cognate language still retain this command over their hereditary resources, and in point of ready intelligibility and picturesqueness they have an important advantage over langauges which, like the Latin and its derivatives, possess less plastic power. There are in all Gothic tongues numerous compounds of very obvious etymology, which are not eminently expressive, considered as a part of what may be called the nature-speech of man, as contrasted with that which is more appropriately the dialect of literature and art, and thus those languages are rich just where, as I remarked in a former lecture, our own is growing poor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The vocabulary belonging to the affections, the terms descriptive of the spontaneous action of the intellectual and moral faculties, the <em>pictorial words which bring the material creation vividly before us</em>, these languages in question are all more numerous and forcible than Latin terms by which we have too often supplied their places. The facility of derivation and composition in Greek and Gothic languages is almost unlimited, and a native once master of the radicals (common words), and fully possessed of the laws of formation, can at any time extemporize a word for the <em>precise</em> expression of any complete idea he may choose to embody in a single vocable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Professor says the English is rich in the language of literature and art. A self-developed language is better for those branches, also, because in all cases it will be necessary to <em>understand, remember and feel</em>.</p>
<p>The Postmaster-General, Stephan, of Berlin has forbidden any foreign words to be used in the postal service, and ordered homogeneous German words to be substituted. The architects of Germany held lately a convention in which it was agreed to substitute homogeneous German words in the fine art of architecture. The &quot;German Language Association&quot; are constantly driving out what foreign words are still remaining, both in literature, science and art, because harmonious self-developed words are more understood, longer remembered, more definite, more vivid to high and low. In Germany they speak about men who have labored for language purification as benefactors of das Vaterland. Over the grave of the linguist Jakob Grimm is raised a beautiful monument. The Russians are beginning to follow the Germans in this respect. We shall soon hear of an agitation for the improvement of the Chinese language.</p>
<h1 id="a-pure-language-enjoys-more-love"><a class="header" href="#a-pure-language-enjoys-more-love">A Pure Language Enjoys More Love</a></h1>
<p>English is not blood of our blood nor flesh of our flesh. Fifty-three per cent of the words are borrowed. It is just as impossible for an Englishman to love his language as much as a German loves his, as it is for a white man to love a negro child as much as his own. It would be an unnatural and insane love. The greater part of the words in the English are unkind and expensive intruders, forced on the English against their will by William the Conqueror, who was a grandson of Gang Rolf, a Norwegian pirate that had settled in the Providence of Normany with his countrymen. They married French wives, as they were nearly all single men. Hence, the Norman-French were a mixture of Norwegian and French. What is our own Anglo-Saxon inheritance we <em>keep</em>, and only systematize a little here and there. I want to ask the Englishman (is it a very heart-stirring request to ask?) in the interest of millions of school children, that he give up, not what is his own, but simply give up French, Latin, Greek, Turkish, Arabic and Chinese words, and that he honor his <em>own</em> Anglo-Saxon and Germanic material, so that his people can understand and love his language. In the United States there is, of course, less reason to love this mixed language than in England. Can't the English purify language as well as Germans, Skandinavians and Russians? Do the English people need an easily understood language for their schools and their people any less than other nations?</p>
<p>The education of a vast mass is a serious expense, even with the easiest understood and remembered tongues, but with English a highest popular intelligence is out of the question. A few University men will get a little taste of science, and the common people will be excluded from science.</p>

<p>It has been shown in chapter d, on spelling, that it costs, other things being equal, $10 more per year for teaching in English than in German and Skandinavian schools on account of spelling, and this makes it also very difficult to learn to read and write. It has also been shown that every child wastes three years of time in mastering this spelling.</p>

<p>Now comes the tug of war! Here we have to stop tearing down. Now comes the inspection and judgment of the new house! Will the future masters accept the building, wholly or partially? Is the house large enough? The foundation broad enough? Is it high enough? Is it ornamental enough? Will the builder be encouraged to go on?</p>
<h3 id="declension-conjugation-and-comparison"><a class="header" href="#declension-conjugation-and-comparison">Declension, Conjugation and Comparison</a></h3>
<p>These are the great trinity in grammar, and is of ten times more value than all other things combined, because they occur in every sentence, while other points appear only occasionally. It is furthermore of the utmost importance that the system of <em>declension, conjugation and comparison</em> should be so well constructed, and so much in harmony with the nature of language in general, that its friends may be willing to let it stand unchanged.</p>
<p>It can readily be seen that this is the first and most necessary agreement. Here are students learning it in different parts of the world. Some will become aware of a change during one month, others at other times, and great confusion will arise from disagreement among its friends. We may change spelling, prefixes, suffixes, single words and compounds, and yet all these will not cause one-tenth the confusion as a change in declension, conjugation and comparison, as each of those other ideas occur only occassionally, and are more or less explained by context, but the latter appear so frequently as soon to become a part of the mind.</p>
<p>The importance of agreeing on declension, conjugation and comparison was seen fifteen years ago, hence all the Germanic, Romanic, Greek, Latin, Russian and Slavonic grammars have been ransacked that we might have suggested to us the best possible grammatical inflections. I have consulted ministers and professors of language from year to year, translated chapter after chapter of this or that book to try the inflections and the language, and then changed the inflections from time to time, as consultation and actual experience progressed from one year to another. In 1872 and 1873 I traveled over 400 miles to stay three months at the University of Wisconsin, in order to have daily consultations with its Professors, especially Carpenter Feuling, R.B. Anderson and others. Short and simple as this grammar is, I am actually ashamed to tell any one how much time and thought I have spent on the inflectional forms of this language.</p>
<p>In adopting affixes for declension, conjugation and comparison, several ideas had to be harmonized. First, the forms must be as Germanic and as conservative as possible, to be in harmony with the taste and history of our people, for which they are intended; second, the forms must be euphonious, to make them sound pleasantly in speaking and singing; third, the forms must be as short as possible, on account of their great frequency; fourth, one form must be well distinguished from every other form; fifth, they must be of such nature as to be capable of being added to all words where they are applicable, in other words, they must be capable of following the adopted rules with euphony and clearness. We have preserved from the old grammar all that could be preserved compatible with euphony, purity and clearness. Where we have been obliged to deviate from our own grammar, the next best thing was to be in harmony with other tried languages. THis will facilitate acquisition, and hence make it more adapted to international communication among other nations.</p>
<h3 id="more-vowels"><a class="header" href="#more-vowels">More Vowels</a></h3>
<p>It was shown in chapter <em>pp</em>, on the &quot;Defects of the English Language,&quot; Defect No. 5, that we have entirely too few vowels. It is in vowels that euphony and musicalness principally lie. A consonant is the strong male; a vowel the beautiful female. A consonant desires a vowel and a vowel a consonant, just as the man attracts the woman and a woman attracts a man. We find, therefore, that the best sounding words are those where vowels and consonants are pretty evenly blended. We cannot do much to change ordinary words, which we must generally take as we find them. The easiest method to enrich our language with vowels is to adopt them for inflectional purposes, as inflections are merely the turning pins of language. In this way the words themselves remain unchanged, and only qualifying letters are added.</p>
<h3 id="forming-the-plural"><a class="header" href="#forming-the-plural">Forming the Plural</a></h3>
<p><em>Rule</em>—Words ending on a vowel add the consonant <em>s</em>, as 1 da (day), 2 das; 1 flį (fly), 2 flįs; and words ending on a consonant add the vowel <em>ä</em> (as heard in <em>and</em>), as 1 hɤs (house), 2 hɤsa; 1 hors, 4 horsa; 1 händ, 2 händä.</p>
<p>Let us now ask, have we fulfilled all the beautiful promises as well as they can be fulfilled? The promise of making the forms Germanic, conservative, short, euphonious and in harmony with language in general? We think we have. The Anglo-Saxons formed plurals by adding <em>ä</em>; plural of hand is händä, of sun (son) is sunä. The Friesic, the oldest branch of the German tongue, did the same, as <em>hond</em> (hand), plural <em>honda</em>. The Germans and Skandinavians form many plurals on <em>e</em>, but this sounds something like <em>a</em>, and was more often <em>a</em> in ancient times. In principle it is the same. They use a vowel to form the plural and that, too, a related one, as ein <em>hund</em> (hound), zwei <em>hunde</em>; eine <em>hand</em>, zwei <em>hande</em>; Skan. en <em>hest</em> (a horse), 2 <em>heste</em>; en <em>hund</em>, 2 <em>hunde</em>. In Irish <em>e</em> or <em>a</em> is used to form the plural, as <em>seamrog</em> (shamrock), pl. <em>seamroga</em>; <em>clearseac</em> (harp), pl. <em>clearseaca</em>; sometimes <em>t</em> comes before the final vowel, as <em>seol</em> (sail), pl. <em>seolta</em>; <em>mur</em> (wall), pl. <em>murta</em>; peist, pl peiste. The Italians end most of their plurals on <em>e</em> or <em>i</em>, as <em>la casa</em> (the house), but pl. <em>le case</em> (kahsa); <em>cavallo</em> (horse), <em>cavalli</em> (horses). In Latin we have also plurals on <em>a</em>, as <em>exemplum</em>, pl. <em>exempla</em>; <em>regnum</em> (kingdom), pl. <em>regna</em>. In Greek all plurals in the nominative end on vowels, except in the third declension, with <em>es</em>. Most plurals take <em>a</em> and <em>ai</em>. Ex.: <em>Morion</em>, pl. <em>moria</em>. In Slavonic <em>a</em>, <em>e</em> and <em>i</em> are used much as plural signs, as <em>tat</em> (thief), pl. <em>tata</em>; <em>grad</em> (castle), pl. <em>grada</em> or <em>gradovi</em>; <em>zob</em> (tooth), pl. <em>zoba</em> or <em>zobje</em>. In Swedish nouns an <em>r</em> is often added to the <em>a</em>, as <em>arm</em> (arm), pl. <em>armar</em>, but plural definite adjectives always end on <em>a</em>, as the good ones, the mighty ones, <em>de goda</em>, <em>de magtiga</em>. We have shown, I think, that <em>a</em> as a plural sign obtains in the Germanic, Irish, Romanic, Latin, Greek and Slavonic tongues, hence it must be in harmony with language in general, as well as with our own family. It cannot be made shorter than <em>a</em> and <em>s</em>—one letter only in each case. It cannot be made more euphoniuos than an open, spreading vowel. The rule can also be applied in all cases, without one exception! We need not say much about <em>s</em>, as that is retained from the old grammar. <em>S</em> is a good coalescing sound much favored by the Greeks, but we use it too much in the present English. <em>S</em> is a plural sign in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Volapuk.</p>
<p>What an easy and simply rule for forming the plural, namely vowels take <em>s</em>, and consonants take <em>ä</em>. No exceptions. Now we have a dozen ways of forming plurals, and some nouns have no plurals. That throws a doubt on all words. Each word necessitates an act of special memory. We say 2 das, 3 kɤs (3 cows), 4 rɷs (4 rows), 5 ʃus (5 shoes), but 2 wördä (2 words), 4 händä, 5 penä, 3 horsä, 2 katä, 3 mɤsä (3 mice), 2 was, 3 rɷdä. </p>
<h3 id="possessive-case"><a class="header" href="#possessive-case">Possessive Case</a></h3>
<p><em>Rule</em>—Consonants add ɷ, as heard in <em>old</em>, and vowels <em>nɷ</em>. Examples: Manɷ hata (man's hats); horsɷ fíd (horse's feed) or the feed of the horse or the feed owned by the horse); the hat owned by the man;  händɷ strongį (strength of the hand). Strength being such a harsh-sounding combination of vowels, we have changed such abstract nouns as strength, length, height, depth, width and breadth to regular and euphonious self-explaining derivative abstracts, by adding the old abstract sound į to the corresponding adjectives, strong, long, high, deep, wide and broad, and say strongį (strength), Ger. starke, Skan. sturke; longį (length), Ger. lange, Skan langde; hįį, Ger. hohe; dípį, Ger. tiefe; wįdį, brodį (breite). The bɷrdɷ longį (the length of the board).</p>
<p>We cannot give so many direct precedents of <em>ɷ</em> or <em>o</em> as a possessive sign as we did of <em>ä</em> as a plural sign, but the principle of using a vowel to designate the possessive is very general in language. We find in Anglo-Saxon the possessive plural very frequently end on <em>a</em> or <em>ena</em>, as <em>scipu</em> (ships), the possessive is <em>scipa</em> (of ships); <em>händä</em> is plural nominative and singular possessive, and even plural possessive, one sign for three ideas! In Irish we also find a vowel to designate the possessive case. In Slavonic vowels very frequently give the possessive. In Latin <em>a</em>, <em>u</em> and <em>i</em> are used as possessive sign, and in plural <em>orum</em> (ohroom). In Greek the sound of ɷ is usually used in connection with <em>n</em> to form the plural possessive; <em>logoi</em> (words), possessive <em>logɷn</em> (of words); <em>nautia</em> (sailors), <em>nautɷn</em> (of sailors). Our possessive ending ɷ may be looked upon as an abbreviated Greek possessive. In the singular we find <em>ou</em> used much as a possessive sign, as <em>demou</em> (of people), dative <em>demɷ</em> (to people), pl. possessive <em>demɷn</em>. In Irish we find o (ɷ, oh) used much as a possessive in so frequent words as pronouns, as me (I), <em>mo</em> (my), thu (thou), <em>do</em> (thine).</p>
<p>What first suggested ɷ as a possessive sign was the little word <em>own</em> (ɷn). For some time we did say &quot;manɷn hat,&quot; but as this ended on a consonant, the <em>n</em> was dropped, under the feeling that English has too few vowels. This sign was thus made shorter and more euphonious. We have, however, other direct examples of ɷ being used as possessive sign, as Greek nom. <em>neɷs</em> (temple), poss. <em>neɷ</em> (of temple); <em>anɷgeɷn</em> (chamber), poss. <em>anɷgeɷ</em> (of chamber). We have taken ɷ to form the possessive after consonants because we wanted a vowel, also because ɷ springs from our word, <em>ɷn</em> (own), <em>ɷnership</em>. This vowel is the most suggestive and euphonious we can have and it has more direct and indirect examples in its favor than anyh other vowel we can find. At last we may say we have taken ɷ as a possessive sign after consonants as a mechanical necessity. We have seen <em>ä</em> has been taken to form the plural, as one hand, two <em>händä</em>, and we cannot use the same sign for so frequent and different ideas, as that would lead to misunderstanding and be less artistic, less scientific, less variety, less euphonious and more monotonous. Neither can we take <em>o</em> as heard in <em>or</em>, for that is the most universally used vowel to designate the past tense in verbs, as we shall soon show. (I love, lovo, lovd.) Neither can we take <em>i</em>, as that is an extensive adjective sign, as windi (windy), sandi (sandy), stoni, wateri. Neither can we take į (<em>i</em> as heard in <em>ice</em>) to form the possessive, as that is best adapted to serve as an abstract ending, being so used in all the Germanic languages. Ex.: <em>tyranny</em>; the finaly <em>y</em> was originally <em>i</em>, and pronounced by some people as <em>ee</em> and by others as <em>į</em>. The Germans say <em>tyrannei</em> (pro. tyranį'); Skandinavian <em>tyrani</em> (pro. tyraní, tyranee'); į is also an abbreviation of the German abstract endings <em>heit</em> and <em>keit</em> (hįt, kįt); Hollandish <em>heid</em> (hįd); longį (length), German <em>lange</em> (pro. langay); brodį (breadth), German <em>breite</em> (pro. brįtay). Neither can we take ɑ (<em>ɑ</em> as heard in <em>arm</em>, <em>far</em>) as a possessive sign, as that is eminently a feminine sign in all civilized languages, adn of which every linguist is already aware. We find Julius, Julia (ah); Frederik, Frederika. We have, therefore, adopted ɑ (ah) as the feminine suffix. Ex. <em>frend</em> (friend), <em>frendɑ</em> (female friend); Ger. <em>freundin</em>, Skan. <em>veninde</em>; hírɷɑ (heroine), <em>singɑ</em> (female singer); Ger. <em>sangerin</em>, Skan. <em>sangerinde</em>. Although ɑ (ah, <em>arm</em>) is felt as a feminine suffix in all languages, yet the Spaniards and especially the Italians, make the most extended use of it for that purpose, and use this suffix even to increase their vocabulary, as <em>senor</em> (lord, sir), <em>senora</em> (lady, madame); <em>hermano</em> (brother), <em>hermana</em> (sister). In Italian <em>zio</em> (pro. tzee-oh) is uncle, but aunt is <em>zia</em>; <em>figlio</em> (son, pro. feeleeoh, fílíɷ), but daughter is <em>figlia</em>.</p>
<p>Having a feminine suffix, it would hardly be treating the males fairly not to have a <em>masculine suffix</em> also. As the long sound of <em>ee</em> (í) is associated with the masculine pronoun <em>he</em> (hí), we have taken that to conveniently distinguish the <em>masculine</em> from the <em>feminine</em> in nouns and verbs, as <em>frendí</em> (male friend), <em>frendɑ</em> (female friend); singí, singɑ; tíchí, tíchɑ (male or female teacher). This &quot;í&quot; (ee) is an open, spreading and clear sound. The <em>ee</em> (í) is now used with a few words to denote the recipient of certain acts, as <em>payer</em> and <em>payee</em>, <em>drawer</em> and <em>drawee</em>. This is a French idea, but has no good holding in language. The relation is an objective one, and we have therefore associated it with the objective <em>ím</em> (<em>him</em>), Ger. <em>ihm</em>, Skan. <em>ham</em>. <em>ím</em> does not show case as <em>em</em>, but only denotes a recipient relation, as <em>payer</em>, <em>payím</em> (payeem); the <em>ee</em> (í) sound is preserved, but differentiated by <em>m</em>, <em>drawer</em>, <em>draweem</em>, <em>droím</em>.</p>
<p>As &quot;í&quot; (ee), the masculine suffix, terminates the masculine pronoun <em>hí</em> (he), so ought &quot;ɑ,&quot; the feminine suffix, to terminate the feminine pronoun, as <em>hɑ</em> (she.) We might have said <em>shɑ</em>, but that does not sound well. To use <em>h</em> for both masculine and feminine pronouns is an old Germanic principle. The Anglo-Saxons said <em>he</em> for <em>he</em> and <em>heo</em> for <em>she</em>. In Danish and Norwegian <em>he</em> is <em>han</em> and <em>she</em> is <em>hun</em> (hoon). In the dialects <em>ho</em>, <em>ha</em> or <em>hu</em>. The difference is only in the vowel. Swedish <em>he</em> is <em>han</em> and <em>she</em> is <em>hon</em>. The same holds in the Friesic, the oldest branch of the German language, as <em>hit</em> (it), <em>hi</em> (he), <em>hju</em> or <em>hu</em> (she). In Irish <em>he</em> is <em>se</em> and <em>she</em> is <em>si</em>. <em>hí</em> (he), <em>hím</em> (him), <em>hɑ</em> (she), <em>hɑm</em> (her, objective).</p>
<p><em><strong>(Digitizer's note: I have used the letter &quot;ư&quot; for the original &quot;oo&quot; sound. I could not find the original letter Molee used. The original letter had a little tag in the upper left of the u.)</strong></em></p>
<p>Neither can we take for the possessive token and sound &quot;ư&quot;, <em>u</em>, as in <em>ooze, rude</em>*, or as <em>o</em> in <em>do</em> (dư), because that sound being associated with the early word <em>dư</em> (doo, do) is the most fitting and suggestive termination we can find to serve as a general verbalizer. &quot;ư&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;dư&quot; (do), as &quot;fy&quot; is an abbreviation of the Latin <em>facio</em> (I do, I make), and as *í&quot; is an abbreviation of <em>hí</em> (he), &quot;ɑ&quot; of <em>hɑ</em> (she), &quot;ɷ&quot; of ɷn (own), &quot;į&quot; of <em>heit, keit</em> and <em>heid</em>, as &quot;d&quot; in <em>loved</em> is an abbreviation of <em>did</em>, and <em>did</em> or <em>dodo</em> (dưdư).</p>
<p>We very much need an abbreviated Germanic suffix by which to render adverbs, adjectives and nouns into verbs conveniently. ư (oo), from dư (do), can serve us as well as <em>fy</em>, from <em>facio</em>, in Latin and French. We have now <em>en</em>, <em>fy</em>, <em>ize</em>, <em>ate</em>, and many others. This is a defect before explained in chapter <em>pp</em>, on &quot;Defects of the English Language,&quot; Defect No. 4. As in a large business we do best to delegate each particular work to special superintendents, so is it best in language to delegate special work to special affixes, hence &quot;ư&quot; is our general <em>verbalizer</em>, as <em>dɑrken</em> is <em>dɑrkư</em>, that is dark-do shortened to dɑrkư. Shorten is <em>shortư</em>; widen is <em>wįdư</em>; beauty is <em>ʃönį</em>; beautiful, <em>ʃön</em>; beautify, ʃönư; systemize is <em>ordsetư</em>; systematic is <em>ordsetı</em> or <em>ordsetık</em>; terminate, <em>endư</em>; exterminate, <em>outrıdư</em>; example <em>bįspíl</em>; exemplify, <em>bįspílư</em>.</p>
<p>The diphthongs, ꝍ (oil) and ɤ (owl), are not euphonious enough for a very much used possessive affix, which must also often help to form compound words: <em>statɷwesn</em>, affairs of state; Ger. <em>staatswesen</em>; Skan. <em>statsvasen</em>. Here the &quot;ɷ&quot; comes in nicely to part the hard consonants and lend euphony to the word. How much more musical than <em>s</em>!</p>
<p>The new sounds, <em>ü</em> and <em>ö</em>, though fine open, spreading vowels, are not sufficiently known to serve such prominent purpose as forming the possessive case, and even if taken could not be better than &quot;ɷ.&quot; The short vowels, <em>u</em> (but), &quot;ɯ&quot; (full) and <em>e</em> (let), cannot be used for affixes, as they cannot be prolonged and accented well enough. Only a (ay) is left, and that is used as imperative sign, and also with <em>an</em>, as the <em>wįsan</em> (the wise one).</p>
<h3 id="possessive-case--continued"><a class="header" href="#possessive-case--continued">Possessive Case — <em>Continued.</em></a></h3>
<p>The <em>nɷ</em> after vowels may puzzle some one at first. The <em>n</em> is a euphonistic letter thrown in to assist the pronunciation, and as <em>n</em> is the easiest pronounced consonant we have, and has the best foundation in language, it has been adopted for that purpose. The Romans strengthen the possessive case by inserting <em>n</em>, <em>virgo, virginis</em>; <em>natio, nationis</em>; <em>religio, religionis</em>; <em>sermo, sermonis</em>. In Greek we find <em>ɑuxɷ</em> and <em>ɑuxɑɷ</em> (to increase). Nearly all languages use euphonistic letters. English <em>n</em> is already employed as such. Ex.: <em>ɑ</em> hen, but <em>ɑn owl</em>. As <em>n</em> in this case is added to <em>ɑ</em> to assist the articulation, so is <em>n</em> prefixed to the &quot;ɷ&quot; after vowels. There is this objection to <em>nɷ</em>, that it looks like the negative adverb <em>no</em>, but the negative affixes are always <em>prefixed</em>; besides that, we have changed <em>no</em> to <em>nay</em>, as the Anglo-Saxons had it. It ought to have been changed long ago, so as not to have the same sound as <em>know</em>. We ought to have different sounds for different ideas, at least very common ideas. When <em>know</em> becomes <em>nɷ</em> and <em>no</em> <em>na</em> (nay), there will not be any misleading associations about this affix. <em>N</em> is a highly-favored sound in all languages. Ex.: <em>Manɷ hat</em> (man's hat). The possessive of <em>fly</em> becomes <em>flįnɷ</em>, and <em>fly's wings flįnɷ wınga</em>; <em>da</em>, poss. <em>danɷ</em>, and <em>day's burdens</em> becomes <em>danɷ burdna</em>.</p>
<p>Now let us see how beautifully we can form the possessive of the plural. Plural is formed by adding <em>ä</em> after consonants and <em>s</em> after vowels. 1 flį, 2 flįs; 1 wörd, 2 wördä. The possessive adds ɷ after consonants and <em>nɷ</em> after vowels. <em>flį</em>, poss. <em>flįnɷ</em>, pl. <em>flįs</em>, pl. poss. <em>flįsɷ</em>; word, poss. wördɷ, pl. <em>wördä</em>, pl. poss. wördänɷ; <em>da</em>, <em>danɷ</em>, <em>das</em>, <em>dasɷ</em>. Having a doubly constructed rule to meet the double nature of letters, namely, consonants and vowels, we cannot become entangled.</p>
<p>This mode of forming the possessive will give an Italian sweetness to the sound of many words, and do much to make the language liked and studied by our neighbors in Mexico and South America and Southern Europe if we should adopt it. Here is a list of very common Italian words:</p>
<p><em>Italiano</em> (pro. eetahleeahnoh, ítɑlíɑnɷ), <em>vendo, vendi</em> (ee), <em>vendono, erano, sono, eglino, qualcuno, hanno.</em> Spanish, <em>veneno, tresoro, camino, mundo</em> (moondoh), <em>mano</em>; <em>hermosa manana</em> (beatiful morning), <em>Castellano</em>.</p>
<p>Now as many of our plurals end on <em>ä</em> (as heard in <em>at, and</em>), we have such words as <em>wördä</em>, <em>händä</em>, <em>housä</em>; poss. plural, <em>wördänɷ</em>, <em>händänɷ</em>, and <em>hɤsänɷ</em>.</p>
<h3 id="extra-objective-sign"><a class="header" href="#extra-objective-sign">Extra Objective Sign.</a></h3>
<p>The objective case is formed by adding <em>em</em> to the nominative only when we desire the <em>object</em> to precede the <em>subject</em> or <em>predicate</em>. <em>Him saw he</em>, or He saw him; <em>Johnem saw Smith</em>, or Smith saw John. An objective case, it is true, is not of so much value as a <em>possessive</em> one, which all Germanic languages have clung to in prosperity and adversity, yet an extra objective sign is well to have in case we want to allow ourselves the same freedom of position enjoyed by the Greeks, Romans or in Volapuk. &quot;ɷ&quot; will also be occasionally used as an adverbial sign, as <em>s</em> in German or <em>o</em> in Volapuk. <em>nįtɷ</em>, Ger. <em>nachts</em>.</p>
<h3 id="personal-pronouns"><a class="header" href="#personal-pronouns">Personal Pronouns</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>(Digitizer's note: Molee created his own letters for &quot;th&quot; sounds. I will use the modern Icelandic.)</strong></em></p>
<p>On this point I think it is better to be pretty conservative, and to take the personal pronouns as they are, with nearly all the irregularity that is in them, because they are so frequent and so thoroughly registered in the mind that a change will hurt the feelings of the people more here than anywhere else. It is fortunate, however, that in this case we can allow them to be irregular and actually improve the language in doing so, as they are shorter than the regular method would have made them. For instance, į (I) and <em>mį</em> (my); the <em>my</em> would become <em>įnɷ</em>, as the rule is to add &quot;nɷ&quot; after vowels to form the possessive, but a word like <em>my</em> (mį), which is spoken so often by so many men, had better be short. It will make innumerable sentences understood the first time they are seen by leaving the pronouns intact, or nearly so. The only change made in the present pronouns is for the purpose of avoiding likeness with some other form that might lead to confusion, as <em>thee</em> (þí) is changed to þoum (þɤm) to avoid the article <em>the</em> (þí). It would not do to have so frequent words alike. <em>She</em> has been changed to <em>hɑ</em> to make it end on &quot;ɑ,&quot; the feminine suffix, in order to establish a suggestive harmony between suffix and pronoun, as before explained. We are obliged also to have <em>n</em> with the possessive of <em>hí</em> and <em>hɑ</em> (she), so as not to collide with the plural forms of <em>s</em>, as <em>hín</em> (his), <em>hís</em> (they, mas.), <em>hɑs</em> (they, fem.) Plural is formed by adding <em>s</em> after vowels and <em>nɷ</em> after consonants. The ɷ is dropped with so frequent words as pronouns, as here there is no danger of its being mistaken for the past participle by dropping the ɷ, which would be the case with other words. We have tried as much as possible to keep the old forms and also to reduce them to monosyllables, as they are so frequent. The plural objective of hí (he) we call <em>hem</em>, being a contraction of <em>he</em> and <em>them</em>. The regular form for the plural objective of <em>hɑ</em> (she) would be <em>hɑsem</em>, <em>hɑ</em> being the singular nominative, <em>s</em> the plural sign, and <em>em</em> the objective sign; but <em>hɑsem</em> is rather long for so frequent word, and does not need the aid of composition and regular derivation to make it suggestive, as more rare words do. Frequency of repetition will ingraft these words into the mind firmly enough anyhow.</p>
<p>We have therefore called <em>hɑsem</em> <em>lem</em>, the last being a contraction of <em>lady</em> and <em>them</em>; <em>tem</em>, from <em>it</em> and <em>them</em>. This will also make a good distinction between the singular and plural of <em>itm</em> and <em>tem</em> and <em>them</em>. As we have special forms for the <em>masculine, feminine and neuter</em> pronouns in the singular number, we ought to have such distinctions in the plural. In Slavonic there is such dictinction, also in Volapuk. It will be convenient in stories when speaking of man and woman in the plural as well as in the singular. There is a new pronoun that we actually need, and which has been pointed out many years ago by several grammarians. That is a pronoun to stand for <em>hí</em> or <em>hɑ</em> (he or she). Ex.: &quot;Let every person think of <em>his</em> and <em>her</em> duty.&quot; If we had a pronoun of the third person, common gender, we would not need to repeat as above. The pronoun <em>ír</em> (eer) has been taken, as it is short, of old standing, and as it will establish suggestive harmony between pronoun and the personal endings of many nouns, as <em>er</em> is changed to <em>ír</em> (old form), which will be explained under Comparison. Sendír (eer), writír, workír, payím (payee), etc.</p>

<h3 id="sįn-sıg-män"><a class="header" href="#sįn-sıg-män">&quot;Sįn, Sıg, Män.&quot;</a></h3>
<p>The above words are of great convenience in language, and have been employed in Anglo-Saxon and in German tongues from Ulfila's days (Fourth Century) down to the present time. <em>Sįn</em>, Ger. <em>sein</em>, Skan. <em>sin</em>, A.-S. <em>sin</em>, Goth. <em>seins</em>, Lat. <em>suus, -a, -um</em>. The Skandinavians make the most profitable use of it, as they use <em>sįn</em> only when it refers to the subject, otherwise <em>his, her</em> (hennes) or <em>its</em>. In this way we shall use it, as we can thus obtain a valuable subjective and objective distinction. <em>Sıg</em> is a general reflexive pronoun used in German. Ex.: <em>He</em> hurt himself, or <em>She</em> hurt herself, will be, <em>He hört sig, Hɑ hört sig</em>. Ger. <em>sich</em>, Skan. <em>sig</em>, Goth. <em>sis</em> or <em>sik</em>, Lat. and Fr. <em>se</em>. <em>Män</em> is an indefinite personal pronoun much needed, and a slight introduction is already begun in Harvard and Yale, as <em>Män says</em> (they say, one says), Ger. <em>man sagt</em>, Skan. <em>man siger</em>, Fr. <em>on dit</em>. <em>Män kan not find him</em> (they cannot find him). For specimens of application see <em>Readl</em> (Reader).</p>
<h3 id="conjugation-of-verbs"><a class="header" href="#conjugation-of-verbs">Conjugation of Verbs</a></h3>
<p><em>Rule</em>—Past tense is formed by adding <em>d</em> to vowels, I <em>sow</em>, I <em>sowd</em> (sɷd); bird's <em>fly</em>, birds <em>flyd</em> (flįd); and by adding <em>o</em> to consonants—<em>o</em> as heard in <em>or, on, all</em>; I <em>drink</em>, I <em>drinko</em>; they <em>work</em>, they <em>worko</em> (workaw, did work).</p>
<p>We need not say anything in defense of <em>d</em>, as that is the old method preserved, but those words that end on consonants ought certainly to have a more musical suffix than the extremely harsh <em>d</em> and <em>t</em> added as they are without an intervening pronounced vowel, as <em>lovd</em>, <em>workt</em>, <em>shortnd</em>. As explained before, vowels are the best friends of consonants, and as English has very few vowels, we taken a <em>vowel</em> to form the past tense (imperfectum) after <em>consonants</em>.</p>
<p>The other vowels are used for other purposes, but <em>o</em> has been reserved for the past tense, as it is by all odds the vowel most associated with this tense in language. Anglo-Saxon <em>ic nime</em> (I take), <em>we nimadh</em> in the present plural, but in the past tense it changes <em>a</em> to <em>o</em>, <em>we namon</em> (we took, tako); <em>were</em> is <em>waron</em>. In the Swedish the <em>n</em> is worn off but <em>o</em> is retained, as <em>voro</em> (were); A.-S. <em>oeton</em>, Swed. <em>dto</em> (ate), and this final vowel is also retained in the Norwegian dialects, as <em>we ate</em>, <em>we drank</em>, <em>we went</em>, etc., is <em>vi aato, vi drukko, vi gingo, vi spunno, vi soto</em>. In Swedish we <em>bound</em>, we <em>sprang</em>, we <em>found</em>, we <em>won</em>, we <em>sang</em>, is <em>vi bundo, vi sprungo, vi funno, vi vunno, vi sjongo</em>. The Icelandic uses <em>u</em> with the past tense as <em>brunnu, risu, foru, gafu</em>, also, <em>flo, go, do,</em> etc. The Germans and French employ <em>e</em>, as Ger. <em>liebte</em>, Fr. <em>amai, ame, venu</em>, ettc. Vowels are very prominently associated with past tense, but <em>o</em> more than any other. The Old Icelandic past tense sign <em>u</em> has become the modern Swedish and Norwegian <em>o</em>, as Icl. <em>brunnu</em> in the latter <em>brunno</em>. In Friesic, the oldest branch of the German, is <em>o</em> again associated with the past tense in the same way as in Anglo-Saxon, with an <em>n</em>. <em>Makiath</em> (make), <em>makadon</em> (made, <em>mako</em>) and <em>lerdon</em>, <em>brochton</em>, etc. In Italian, Spanish and Portuguese the vowel <em>o</em> always ends the past participle, as <em>united</em> is <em>unido</em> and <em>unito</em>; <em>loved</em> is <em>amado</em> and <em>amato</em>. <em>O</em> is therefore associated with the past form of verbs in Northern and Southern Europe and in all South America, and yet we have not told all, for <em>o</em> is furthermore employed as a final vowel with the past tense in Slavonic, as <em>delam</em> (I work), <em>delas</em> (thou workest), <em>dela</em> (he works); but I worked is <em>delajmo</em>; I bent, <em>nagnimo</em>, from <em>nagnem</em> (I bend); <em>vucimo</em> (I taught) from <em>vucim</em> (I teach). In the last class of words <em>o</em> is the only distinction between the present and past, as <em>vucim</em> (į tích), <em>vucino</em> (į tícho, teached); hí <em>lovo</em> (he lovd); į <em>drinko</em> (drank); we <em>spino</em> (spun), Swed. <em>vi spunno</em>. In Greek <em>o</em> is also used along with the <em>past</em> form of verbs.</p>
<h3 id="present-and-past-participles"><a class="header" href="#present-and-past-participles">Present and Past Participles</a></h3>
<p><em>änd</em> has such a stronghold in all Germanic languages for the present participle that its adoption can only be a question of form. To use the same suffix <em>ing</em> for so different ideas as present participle and verbal nouns is misleading and inartistic. Prof. Marsh has recommended <em>änd</em> for pres. part., but <em>ɑnd</em> is more musical; besides <em>ɑnd</em> is more in harmony with other languages and with the pronunciation of the Anglo-Saxon which did call <em>ä</em> ɑ (far), as lufigɑand (lov<em>ing</em>); hyr<em>ende</em>, <em>hearing</em> (not hearing, the noun); Am. <em>luvɑnd, hírɑnd</em> (verbal noun <em>híring</em>). <em>ɑndi, ɑnde, ɑndo</em> might be adopted as our suffix, but it is so frequent an ending that it must be short; <em>luvɑnd, komɑnd, readɑnd, skrįbɑnd</em> (writing); <em>ɑnd</em> in Anglo-Saxon is <em>end</em> or <em>änd</em>, Old Friesic <em>ände</em>, Danish and Norwegian <em>ende</em>, German <em>end</em>, French <em>ent</em> or <em>ant</em>, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese <em>endo</em> or <em>ando</em>, Swedish <em>ande</em> and Icelandic <em>andi</em>; Latin <em>endi, endo, ändi</em> or <em>ändo</em> (Gerundium).</p>

<p>Concerning the past participle we need not say much, for in this case we have only extended the present use of <em>en</em> or <em>n</em> to all verbs without exceptions. To have the same form for past tense and past participle is not Germanic nor artistic, as it lacks variety, clearness and euphony. <em>n</em> is used in all Germanic languages with the p.p. more or less. Ex. Eng. fall, fell, <em>fallen</em>; Am. <em>foln</em>, Ger. <em>gefallen</em>, Skan. <em>falden</em> (from <em>falde</em>, fall), Icel. <em>fallinn</em>; Hol. <em>gevallen</em>, A.-S. <em>gefeallen</em>.</p>
<p><em>Rule</em>—<em>en</em> added after <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>; after all other words <em>n</em> alone, as hí <em>kom</em> (comes), hɑ (she) <em>komo</em> (came), <em>hí häs komen; wí wın, wí wıno</em> (won), wí hav wınen; hav <em>gıvn</em>, <em>sín, workn</em> and <em>lovn</em>. <em>n</em> is the most coalescing and musical consonant we have, and is much favored in all languages.</p>
<p>There are eight irregular verbs, viz: <em>do, is, have, may, can, will, shall</em> and <em>worth</em> (to become), which have been excepted on account of brevity and frequency.  (See Reader.)</p>
<h3 id="comparison-of-adjectives"><a class="header" href="#comparison-of-adjectives">Comparison of Adjectives</a></h3>
<p>As we merely make a slight modification of the old Germanic method of adding <em>er, est</em> to <em>ɑr</em> and <em>ɑst</em> for the sake of euphony, we need not say much on this point. <em>e</em> is such a short, unmusical vowel that is not good for inflective purposes, hence we have adopted the open, spreading Swedish suffixes, <em>ɑr</em> and <em>ɑst</em>. These endings were also used by the Anglo-Saxons, as <em>sidh</em> (late), <em>sidhra</em> or <em>sidhor</em> and <em>sidhäst</em>; Swed. <em>kar</em> (dear), <em>karare, karast</em>, evenly pronounced, with a slight accent on the first syllable. The regular comparison in Icelandic is to add <em>äri</em> and <em>ästr</em> to the stem. Coler and coldest is <em>käldäri</em> and <em>käldästr</em>. Our comparison is then <em>long, longɑr, longɑst</em>; <em>hį</em> (high), <em>hįɑr, hįɑst</em>, except five irregular adjectives, viz: <em>good</em> or well, <em>bad</em> or ill, <em>much, many</em> and <em>little</em>, which remain as before.</p>
<p><em>er</em> has also been discarded as a personal ending in place of <em>ír</em> (eer) for the old form <em>ir</em>, to obtain a more open, spreading suffix, and also to establish a suggestive harmony betwen the personal <em>ír</em> (hí or hɑ, he or she) and those words referring to personal actors, as <em>rídír</em> (reader), hí or hɑ (she) that reads. Now a book is also called <em>reader</em>.</p>
<p>It is certainly an incomplete language which does not distinguish between persons and things (Ger. <em>leser, lesbuch</em>). In order to bring the language up to the highest point of transparency it will be necessary to provide ourselves with a sign for the <em>impersonal agent</em> as well as for the <em>personal agent</em>, as those thoughts are very frequent and the same word is often used for both ideas. For instance, a machine that thrashes out our grain is called a <em>thrasher</em>, and the person that manages the machine is also called a <em>thrasher</em>. How can we, then, always be sure in such cases whether the <em>thing</em> or the <em>person</em> is meant? Some one might naturally suggest that as the common personal pronoun <em>ír</em> (hí or hɑ) is employed to indicate the personal agent, so might the neuter or impersonal pronoun <em>ıt</em> be employed to indicate the impersonal agent, but we need <em>ıt</em> for another neuter or impersonal indication in which the English language is extremely poor, namely, to show the neuter adjective. This is a point specially lamented by the learned American linguist, Prof. J.P. Marsh. The Greeks have their neuter form <em>To kalon</em>, which conveys an idea we cannot express, even by circumlocution, as that weakens the force of the expression. We have too many useless affixes and not enough useful ones. The Germans, having a masculine, feminine and neuter article, can say <em>der Gute, die Gute, das Gute</em>. We can say <em>the good</em> also, but how indefinite, generic and meaningless in comparison with Greek, German and Skandinavian <em>den goda och det goda</em>. I am satisfied we can drill tthe Amerikan language into excelling them all, and do it so regularly and with so little material, that we shall hardly know we have a grammar after all, on account of its great regularity. We can excel them because we are resting on their shoulders, if we are only willing to use the material at our disposal. Let us try the German <em>der Gute</em>. That means <em>the good man</em> if the talk is about persons, if about cattle <em>der Gute</em> means the good ox; <em>der</em> being a masculine article, <em>der Gute</em> means the good <em>he</em> one, <em>die Gute</em> the good <em>she</em> one, <em>das Gute</em> the good <em>it</em>, the good in the general or abstract. Unlike our English <em>the good, das Gute</em> cannot refer to persons in singular or plural, and in this definiteness of the idea lies its strength and beauty. Let us now make some use of the grammatical material already established. We have the masculine suffix <em>í</em> (ee), to denote masculinity, and &quot;ɑ&quot; to denote femininity, <em>singɑ</em>, female singer; <em>hɑ singer</em> or she singer; Ger. <em>sangerin</em>, Skan. <em>sangerinde</em>, <em>sangí</em> (he singer), <em>sıngɑ</em> (she singer), <em>sıngír</em> (he or she singer).</p>
<p>Now as the Germans say <em>der Gute</em> (the good <em>he</em> one), we can say the <em>goodí</em>; for <em>die Gute</em> (the good <em>she</em> one), we can say the <em>goodɑ</em>, and for <em>das Gute</em> (the impersonal or abstract good), we can say the <em>goodit</em>. <em>Das schöne</em>, the <em>schönıt</em>, and so on with all the adjectives in the language. Just as the Germans prefix <em>das</em> we can suffix <em>it</em>; our own neuter pronoun is very expressive for this purpose. So far we have caught up with the truly great German language, but we can give the same ideas in the plural, and they cannot. <em>Der Gute</em> means the good <em>he</em> one, the <em>goodí</em>. Now we vary the article for case and number as in German, hence we can say <em>dí</em> (<em>the</em>, plural), <em>dí goodís, dí goodɑs, dí gooditɑ</em>, (a plural sign after consonants). <em>Die guten</em> is alike in all genders plural, and can therefore no longer show masculinity, femininity and the neuter. The Skandinavians can say <em>de gode</em> or <em>de goda</em>, which mean the same as the German <em>die guten</em>. Our sister languages are yet ahead of us in other respects, which of course we can catch up with by adopting their methods, and probably systematize and add it for the good of us all. All Germanic material is our ancient inheritance. The Germans and Skandinavians can use the present participle as a personal noun and form plurals from it, and we cannot; they can, moreover show masculinity, femininity and the neuter with it, while we can show nothing of the kind, except by weakening circumlocution. For instance, <em>der liebende, die liebende, das liebende, die liebenden</em>. As we have now established a separate form for the present participle on <em>ɑnd</em>, we can now give those ideas as well as the Germans and Skandinavians, as the <em>lovɑndí</em>, the <em>lovɑndɑ</em>, <em>lovɑndıt</em> (the loving thing) and <em>dí lovɑndírɑ or lovɑndɑ</em> (common gender). It will be noticed that we obtain these valuable distinctions simply by adding a masculine, feminine and neuter suffix, without disturbing the natural relations of the genders, but look at the terribly high price the Greeks, the Germans and Skandinavians pay for these disttinctions. They must use <em>der, die, das</em>, Skan. <em>den</em> and <em>det</em>, as well as different endings, but by varying the articles for gender they have thrown a complexity and burden onto the learner that is hard to master. To the natives who learn this system of genders in early life when time is not of much value, it is all right, probably, but such system is not suited to a cosmopolitan language. If we could obtain their ideas in a simple way, it would be a godsend.</p>
<p>We have however, to train our American bird to higher flights than we have yet done in order to come up to them. They can change their verbs into an <em>infinitive noun</em> with the suffix <em>en</em>, as well as into a <em>verbal noun</em> with <em>ung</em> or <em>ing</em>, and into a <em>participial noun</em> with <em>ende</em> or <em>ande</em>. We have now the two last but not the first, for this reason we have taken the Anglo-Saxon infinitive ending <em>än</em> (an) to stand as the sign of the <em>infinitive noun</em>. Ex.: <em>sıngän</em>, A.-S. <em>singän</em> or <em>syngän</em>, Ger. <em>singen</em> (<em>das singen</em>), Skan. <em>syngen</em> or English <em>singing</em>. The last is participial and verbal noun also. At last we have not their forcible <em>imperative, optative</em> and <em>conjunctive</em> forms, which we must endeavor to obtain in the same simple and cheap way as we have obtained their other ideas. Again, other languages pay a high price also for these valuable distinctions. Some words take umlaut (vowel change), others add <em>e</em>, others both umlaut and <em>e</em> and others remain unchanged. The forms once laid down must be used, whether specially needed or not. We have adopted an imperative, optative and conjunctive form to be used only for emphasis and poetry. &quot;a&quot; being so much like the one employed in Greek, Anglo-Saxon and Skandinavian, has been adopted. We can ordinarily say in the imperative, &quot;<em>leave it!</em>&quot; The imperative is like the infinitive, which causes no confusion, as we have the infinitive sign <em>to</em> (tä). If, however, we should desire to make the command emphatic, especially in writing, where we cannot make <em>leave it</em> emphatic by the voice, we can add &quot;a,&quot; nearly the same sound as used in German <em>e</em> and Greek a, thus emphatic imperative is <em>leava</em>! Ger. <em>verlasse</em> (pr. ferlɑsa), Greek <em>leipa</em>! When the word ends on a vowel a euphonistic <em>t</em> is added, as <em>gɷ</em>, emphatic imperative <em>gɷta</em>. <em>ö</em> has been adopted as the optative, the wishing form, <em>ö</em> as heard in <em>earn</em> (örn); <em>ö</em> being much like the exclamatory vowel <em>o</em> (oh!), is suggestive for this purpose, as <em>ö</em> is much associated with hoping and praying. &quot;O! God, <em>gıvö</em> this. <em>önske</em> in Skan. is <em>wish</em>; <em>ö</em> is also found in the German optative <em>möge</em>. He <em>lovö</em> (oh, that he may love); Ger. <em>möge er lieben</em>, lovö hí! When the word ends on a vowel we insert <em>m</em>, as <em>gɷmö</em> (please go, wish would go). <em>m</em> and a vowel is the standard Greek method of forming the optative, as <em>phainɷ</em> (to show), optative <em>phainoimi</em> (please show), imperative <em>phaina</em>, infinitive <em>phainein</em>; Am. ʃɷän. <em>mö</em> is also in the German optative <em>möge</em>. Volapuk adds <em>ös</em> to form the optative.</p>
<p><em>ı</em> is adopted as a special conjunctive form, as <em>ı</em> is the nearest we can come to the final Anglo Saxon, German and Skandinavian <em>e</em> used for that purpose. A.-S. <em>moeg</em>, conjunctive <em>moege</em>; Ger. <em>mochte</em>; Skan. <em>matte</em>; <em>lovı</em>, if I love. When the word ends on a vowel <em>þ</em> is further added to divide the vowels and give us a fully suggestive suffix of our own material, as <em>I gɷıþ</em>, if I go.</p>
<p>As I cannot find a special interrogative form in any of the Germanic languages, I have not supplied one, as I am only a collector and systematizer of the ideas already found in one or the other of the Germanic tongues, and having selected the good points and left out the bad, I cannot see why the Amerikan language should not be better than the others, as we have rested on their shoulders and they have not rested on ours.</p>
<p><em><strong>(Digitizer's note: Molee originally used &quot;a&quot; for the sound in &quot;at&quot; and &quot;and&quot;. I have switched this to ä.
