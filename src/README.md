> A word should be constructed so that a person who knows the thing may receive all the assistance which the name can give in remembering what he knows, while he, who knows it not, may receive as much knowledge respecting it as the case admits of by merely being told its name.

—John Stewart Mill

> The most perfect language would be one combining the excellencies of several languages into one.

—Lord Bacon

> I have not, in translating the Bible, taken any special dialect of the German, but the best forms thereof, which I could find.

—Martin Luther
