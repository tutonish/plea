The plurals and genetive case end frequently on vowels. It has a very full inflectional system. Adjectives and nouns have plural signs mostly on vowels.

| Single | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| *Ran*, white | bana |
| *Min*, smooth | mine |
| *An bo dub*, the cow black | *Na ba duba*, the cows blacks |
| *Cu*, hound | *ca*, hounds |
| *Dia*, God | *deitha*, gods |
| *La*, day | *leitha*, days |
| *Mi*, month | *miosa*, months |
| *Ua*, grandson | *ui*, grandsons |
| *Seamrog*, shamrock | *seamroga* |
| *Clearseac*, harp | *clearseaca*, harps |
| *Cno*, nut | *cna* or *cnai*, nuts |

It is full of short words as well as long clear compounds, as, *do*, to; *fa*, under; *le*, with; *o* or *na*, from; and *fearfeasa*, prophet; *laocmara*, seal (sea-calf).

The Irish language has a separate passive form, as the Greek, Latin and modern Skandinavian, as *buailtear me* (I am struck; Skan. jeg bankes).

The complexity of the language is a drawback in Irish as in German, it makes it more difficult for its admirers to acquire.

The Irish tongue has the same self-devlopment, the same crystal transparency as the Greek and German. It is more full of open spreading final vowels, which help to make the language musical. It is to be deplored that such a clear popular language has been so opressed.

```
Ah! the pleasant Tongue, whose accents were music to the ear.
Ah! the magic Tongue, that round us wove its spell so soft and dear.
Ah! the glorious Tongue, whose murmur could each Celtic heart enthrall.
Ah! the rushing Tongue, that sounded like the swollen torrent's fall!
```
*Rev. M.M., Ballads of Ireland*
```
Sweet Tongue of our monarchs, our saints and our sages,
Sweet Tongue of our heroes and free-born sires,
When we cease to preserve thee our glory expires.

Ulrich J. Bourke, President of St Jarlrath's College, Tuam, says of Irish: "It is flexible and harmonious as Greek, soft as Italian, and expressive as German."

The Most Rev. Daniel O'Connor, Bishop of Slades, aptly says: "Oh! would that our copious, melodious, soul-inspiring, and heart-moving language were received and had become universal! And whyu should it not? SHould it not be our pride and our boast to have such a language, while other countries rejoice in their jargon—in their compound of various langauges?" Great many societies are being formed in Ireland to preserve and revive the old language. Holland has its own language with 4 million speakers, Norway 2, Sweden 4.5, Portugal 4. Ireland having about 6 millions, and an island country, could easily have her own language for home use. Scholars must study foreign languages anyhow in all civilized nations. *Rev. Bourke* says very forcibly in his Irish Grammar: "If we do not cherich the language for its own sake, why, let us do it for our own. We know the language of a nation is the exponent of a people's antiquity, the index of their refinement, the mouth-piece of their history, the type of their freedom, the echo of a nation's greatness and fame—shall we then let our language die?"

*Bishop O'Connor* says: "Are not Scotland and Wales to be admired for their patriotism? and are they not a reproach to us? But why do their langauges prevail among them? Because they are used as the common language of the country; because they are taught at school and encouraged by nobility and gentry, instead of being ashamed of their mother tongue—as, I am sorry to say, we are generally found to be of ours—or, rather, are sought to be made so by those who are interested in suppressing it as a mark of our nationality."

"Unless this shame of the language of our ancestors cease to exist and a kindred feeling be cultivated generally, and especially by the middle classes of our countrymen, in vain do you labor."

"If I could take the liberty, I would recommend that in every parish in Ireland there should be an Irish teacher, and that as the ear governs the tongue, it may be familiarized by hearing the language spoken at school, at home and abroad; if it were only thus to employ some poor men and women to speak nothing but Irish in the hearing of children, who, in a short time, would acquire a facility in a common place colloquial way."

Rev. Bourke says: "Every nation cherishes its own language; it cherishes it even in death. The Greeks loved their language the more, the more it was banished by the Turkish foe. From the ashes of thraldom they have brought it forth—though bearing another name—fresh and youthful as the phoenix rising in its new creative power, after a literary slumber though ages of woe. The Jew in his exile loves, did his captive sires of old, to sing out in his own sweet Hebrew his sorrows in a strange land. And shall the Irishman, in the land of his birth, neglect to cultivate what has been justly called "the language of song—the language of the heart—the sweet mellow language of *Eire go bragh*?"
