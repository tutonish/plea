## Injury of Unrelated Foreign Words

Thinking is classifying previous impressions. We think by means of particular images, or, in other words, we think by means of impression received through the five sense. We have an idea of white, black, eye and fish from having seen it, hard, smooth, soft and rough from having felt it, the different sounds from having heard them, sweet and sour from having tasted it. Thinking is gathering, to remember is to recollect, to gather again. The Latin *coagitare*, cogitate, is a putting or shaking together in the mind. A general or abstract idea is only a grouping or classification of individual particular impressions. For this reason is it of vital importance that a thing should be named according to the nature of the images necessary to the idea wanted, in such a way that the mind may be carried back and be reminded of the original particular impressions or images that must be gathered to build up the thought.

*Oculist* is a bad word for the reason that it is arbitrary. There is no gathering of images. We understand it only after extra memorizing. He might just as well have been called x, u, or y.

We think only in particulars, as, *eye* and *healer* (from heal, to cure), hence *eyehealer*, Ger. *augenarzt*, from the particular previous impressions of *augen* (eyes) and *arzt* (healer or doctor), Skan. *oienlage* (eyehealer), from *oien* (eyes) and *lage* (healder, curer). The idea underlying this natural self-developing system of producing terms is that each object, not mathematical, shall be named by means of the proper particular images previously acquired in childhood. A double use is hence made of early learned base-words, making them doubly firm in memory. They are first employed to designate the common ideas when needed, as *eye*, *healer*, *fish* and *lore*; A.S. *lar*, Ger. *lehre*, Skand. *lare*, Eng. *lore*, *learning*, *science*. The same common words, so well and early engrafted in the mind, by the nature of our necessities are secondly *gathered* to build higher words of which they serve as explainers and remembrancers. Having once obtained an image of *eye*, *healer*, *fish* and *lore*, such names as *eyehealer* (oculist) and *fishlore* (ichthyology); Ger. *fischlegre*, Skand. *fiskelare* (science of fishes) become self-explaining.

The Greeks who called a fish *ichthus*, and lore or learning *logia*, could with great advantage gather their impression and say *ichtyologia*. Prof. Schlecher says: "We should *see* and *feel* through language."

There is a deep psychological principle underlying this simple mode of names-giving, which, when understood, will place arbitrary foreign borrowing in a bad light, whatever people resort to it.

What is gained by self-developed words? We gain five very valuable points and lose none.

1. More thoughts understood.
2. More thoughts remembered.
3. More thoughts definite.
4. More thoughts vivid.
5. More love for the tongue.
