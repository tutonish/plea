# First Point—*More Understanding*.

As we think in particular images it is evident that those languages which furnish the hearer with the very images needed to be gathered to build up the thought, as in Greek, German and Irish, are kinder to the understanding than such mixed languages as English, French and Turkish, which give a man not ready prepared thoughts, but mere arbitrary words which he must himself translate into thought the best he can.

A thought is an arrangement or presentation of images, hence, *eyehealer* and *fishlore* are thoughts, while *oculist* and *ichthyology* are mere symbols of thought to us. We understand such isolated words only by special superadded study, as we learn the meaning of x, y and z in algebra. It may be said that *oculist* and *ichthyology* are expressibe to a Latin and Greek scholar. Yes, but that will not help the English language.

We accuse it of being inexpressive to the people at large and wasteful of mental energy. Now, if it is necessary for farmers and businessmen to study Latin in order to understand English, it is all the more true that it is wasteful. *Expressiveness* is that quality of a word which enables the not-learned in the greatest number of instances to correctly anticipate the meaning. Special study will make any word in any language understood.

A word, in order to be expressibe in a full sense, must carry a mans' mind forward to correct conclusions from images furnished by the word itself. If a boy must look to definitions or the dictionary for the meaning, then the word has not inherent expressiveness. From two to five thousand words constitute an ordinary man's range of vocabulary, but we have about one hundred thousand words in a complete dictionary. The fewer words of a language that are gathered and compounded out of the universally understood common words, as in Greek and German, the smaller will the proportion be of understood words, the narrower must the range of thought become among those who use the language.

There is a constant danger of meeting words not expressive enough to be understood. A man hears and sees words in a hundred circumstances. If he hears a word in a sermon or lecture and does not comprehend it, the value of the whole sentence is lost, and that sentence may be needed to explain what follows. There may be no Latin or Greek scholars near by, to explain to the man and he cannot go home after a dictionary, even if he had one. He might write the word down and hunt up the meaning when he got time. Few will take that trouble. If they did, it would be a waste of time and energy necessitated by the inexpressiveness of our language. In Germany and Skandinavia they use no dictionary in the lower schools. None is needed, because all words above the well-known and ever recurring common ones are compounded from such. They very seldom meet a word of which they cannot gather the meaning.

The tendencies of English are injurious to the intellectual habits of a man. A half understood word occurs to-day, another to-morrow morning, to-morrow evening, next day and so on. The man becomes superficial and will at last shun all difficult reading and confine himself to novels, where there is not much Greek and Latin.

I remember once while in the court house of Houston Co., Minn., 1876, I was given one of Henry Ward Beecher's sermons, and I was pleased with his eloquence. He spoke about marching armies. A Greek word came in that stopped the reading. Beecher said in one place: "The sound of the past has been *cacophonous*." Ah! cacophonous. I felt chagrined and humbled to think that after graduating at an American Academy and after having studied so as to speak and enjoy several languages, after having learned considerable Latin and a little Greek, yet I could not understand so popular a production as a sermon. I do not meet words in German or Skandinavian sermons that I do not understand, though I was born in an English speaking country, and have spoken, read and written ten times more English than German or Skandinavian. Is the fault in me or in the heterogeneous character of the language? I will now see how the officers about the court house understood Beecher. I asked the County Auditor, an Indiana man, J. Cooper; the Register of Deeds, an Irishman, James McMahon; the Clerk of the Court, a German, Joseph Vossen; the County Attorney, James O'Brien, who had been a former College Professor. None, except O'Brien, had an idea of what the word meant; he said it was something about sound, but like a wise counselor he looked up the las in the blessed Webster's Dictionary to be sure. "Caco," said he, "means *ill* or *bad*; *phonous* is *sounding*. The Greeks put together *ill* and *sounding*, *illsounding*, it is the opposite of *euphonious*, or *well-sounding*." Is that all that the word means? Oh, father Washington! Here I have tramped from office to office among intelligent American officers to find the meaning of a word containing a very common idea; I had expected to find an elephant and found only a mouse. "Hon. O'Brien," said I, "let us see what the idea is called in the English-German dictionary (Ger. worterbuch, word-book), and let us see how well the German people understand German. We found that *caco*, *ill* or *bad*, is called *ubel* (evil, bad), sound is *laut*, something *loud* that can be heard; *cacophonous* is *ubellautend*, *ill-sounding*. The word is as well understood by Germans as cacophonous was by the Greeks, because they "keep within their base." The former can also say *misslautend* and *missklingend*, and many other self-explaining compounds. When a people once get into the habit of self-compounding, they can produce clear terms, without limit, practically. As Hon. O'Brien and myuself walked to the court house, we asked a twelve years old German boy what *ubellautend* meant. He answered "vat sound nat goot." He understood his word, he needed no dictionary. A Skandinavian boy could have told just as easily what is ment by *illydende* or *ilkingende*. An Irish boy, with his pure self-explaining tongue, could have done the same. The English are probably the most able people in the world, but they labor with an inexpressive tongue, and outside of physical routine work, their language offers insurmountable disadvantages to a wide understanding.

The English people belong to the Germanic race as well as Germany, Skandinavia, Holland and Iceland. The language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons was German interspersed with Skandinavian words. Here is a specimen from Francis A. March's Anglo-Saxon Reader and Grammar:

*Ac sprec us after urum andgite* (knowledge), *dhoet ve moegen understandan dha dhing dhe dhu spricst*. (Translated—Oh! speak to us according to our knowledge that we may understand the thing that thou speakest). Again, Matthew XII: 9, 10: *Da se Hoeland dhanon for* (fared, went) *he come in to heora* (their) *gesamnunge* (congregations), *dha woes dhoer an man se hoefde forscruncene* (forshrunken, withered) *hand*. *And he acsodon* (asked) *hine, dhus cvedhende: Is hit* (it) *alyfed* (allowed) *to hoelanne on reste-dagum*?

*Bird* is *fugel*, *eye* is *eage*, *conversation* is *gesproek*, *boy* is *cnapa*, *strange* or *foreign* is *fremede*, *woman* is *cven* (Skand. kvinde). The Anglo-Saxon had a great number of self-explaining prefixes and suffixes, which gave force to the language and the losss of which Prof. G.P. March so much deplores in his "Lecture's on the English Language."

It is needless to say that no people would ever have taken so many foreign words but after a long foreign oppression. The English language is, therefore, a prominent manifestation of the result of the Norman-French subjugation of England after the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons at Hasting, in 1066. English is not produced naturally by a free people, and it is hardly good enough for our free America, because it is too wasteful of mental energy and cannot be readily understood. Can't we free ourselves from the results of the battle of Hasting, where the English lost the expressiveness of their language?

While at the University of Wisconsin in 1873 and 1874, I saw an account of a school exhibition in a Janesville paper, which stated that a fifteen years old shoolgirl, Hilda Hegg, read an "Essay on *Iconoclasts*." Mr. Arnold, son of a Wisconsin lumberman, and Mr. Maxson, son of a Chicago physician, happened to be present. I asked them what *iconoclasts* meant. Mr. Arnold said he had not heard the word before. He had studied Latin three years and Greek two, but could not understand it. I asked him why he could not understand it after having studied Greek and Latin that much. He said words changed so much in passing from one language to the other, both in form and meaning, that, unless one is an old comparative philologist, he is not always able to trace the relationship, besides there may occur words from Greek and Latin that he has not seen or cannot remember. I told them that, though none of us were Germans, but had studied that language, I thought we could understand it better than our own cosmopolitan English. We found the German word to be *bildersturmer*, from *bilder*, pictures, and *sturmer*, destroyer. Even we understood that, for it was only a *gathering* of ideas furnished by the word itself. The Greeks did the same. In Greek, *eikon* is *picture* or *image*, *klastes*, *breaker*; *eikonoklastes*, *image-breaker*, *picture-destroyer*. The Russians are combining their own common words into higher ones in the same way as the Greeks and Germans. From the word *rod*, whose fundamental signification is *birth*, *generation*, *to produce*, there is a forest of compounds. A family of words cluster about this central word by means of common well understood prefixes and suffixes for actor, masculine or feminine, diminutive or augmentative, above or below, before and after, etc. The word *rod* has 25 self-explaining homogeneous primary compounds and 79 transparent secondary compounds.

The Chinese also compound their own material, as,

| Chinese | English |
| --- | --- |
| Nam | water |
| Me | mother |
| Me-nam | river, that is water-mother |
| Ta | eye |
| Nam-ta | tear, lit. eyewater. |
| Luk | child |
| Mai | tree |
| Luk-mai | fruit, tree-child |
| Klek | iron |
| Reng | power |
| Me-reng | screw, force-mother |
| Me-klek | magnet, iron-mother |
| Son | bow |
| Luk-son | arrow, bow-child |
| Mu | hand |
| Luk-mu | finger, hand-child |

The Chinese, Russian, German and English will, according to human estimation, be the great languages of the future. They are all possessors of large territories and great numbers of speakers and constantly extending their territories throughout the world. Education and literature is only a matter of time, if they have easily understood languages. 300 years ago, or about Luther's time, the Germans were regarded as ignorant country clowns by the Italians; now they stand intellectually above all nations. The Russians are fast coming to the front. Three of the most prominent writers of our time are Russians, namely, Tolstoi, Turgenieff and Ignatieff. They are beginning to take great interest in education. A certain rich Russian count, whose name I have lost, gave lately the largest sum that was ever given to build and maintain people's schools. The sum given was ten million dollars. Mr. Schischkow, in his treatise on the Russian language, urges the expulsion from the language of all words not of Russian or of Slavonic origin, as they destroy mutual expressiveness. Kopitar, in his Russian grammar, urges the idea of systematizing the language by adopting one regular conjugation for all verbs. (See Kopitar's Russian Grammar, pag. 311)

The Russians have as good chance to build school houses as the Germans, English and Americans. As the English is the most mixed and has the least ready intelligibility, it is safe to predict that under equal conditions the English speaking people will possess the least life-guiding knowledge and finally be looked up to by none of the rest, though they are naturally the most talented.

It is very useful and ennobling for a people to study the handiwork of the Almighty Creator. A rich Englishman cannot learn so much science as a German or Russian in his language, but a common Englishman with moderate means is excluded from the grand book of nature. He cannot understand and remember an article in a newspaper or monthly magazine on science, because his language is too mixed. Ideas plain as day to a German farmer is as the night to an English one, yet they belong to the same race and are equally able. For instance: "*Botany is divided into two grand divisions: phanerogamia and cryptogamia.*" Here are three arbitrary non-self-explaining words. Botany the German calls *plantlore*; phanerogamia he calls *fruit-bearers* or *seed-bearers* (fruchttragenden); cryptogamia he calls *non-fruit-bearers* (nicht fruchttragenden), and so on through all the sciences, excepting an extreme scientific idea that seldom comes before the people and for which they have not yet developed their own expression.

In speaking of botany (plantlore), why should we be obliged to say in English *glabrous*, *hirsute*, and *hispid* instead of *smooth*, *shaggy* and *bristly*? Prof. Marsh says: 

> I find in a recent scientific journal this sentence: "Begoniaceae, by their anthero-connectival fabric, indicate a close relationship with anonacio-hydrocharideo-mymphaeoid forms, an affinity confirmed by the serpentarioid flexuoso-nodulous stem, the liriodendroid stipules and cissoid and victorioid foliage of a certain Begonia, and if considered hypogenous, would in their triquestrous capsule, alate seed, apetalism and tufted stamination, represent the floral fabric Nepanthes, itself of aristolochioid affinity, while by its pitchered leaves belonging to Sarracenias and Dionaeas."

May God and the Germanic race help the people of America to get rid of this incomprehensible Babylonian jargon! How can common people read science in English? And we must read or take back-seats among the nations.

The learned Professor and U.S. Ex-Minister to a European Court adds: "The nomenclature of science is often so repugnant to the ear, so refractory to the tongue of our Anglican race, that it never finds admission into the dialect of common life."

It looks to me as if the English language were constructed by some eccentric, rich and learned bachelors who had nothing else to do but hunt up the meaning of words in dictionaries and to spell. It is a remarkable that so busy people should have so time-wasting language. England has had too little sympathy with the middle classes. So unsympathetic a language cannot go on unpunished. The result will be comparative degradation. The United States will not always have a virgin soi, England cannot always live on the sweets of other lands. Germany, Russia and China, with their self-explaining, understanding-helping and memory-helping languages, which they are continually systematizing and enriching, will before long leave us behind with our wheat, corn, hogs, railroads, money bags and incomprehensible words and regard us as Indian princes for our wealth. The world is marching away from the English and Turkish principle of borrowing foreign and unrelated words. A race-feeling is being awakened in all great peoples, which partly manifests itself in language purification. Will it not pay for us Americans also to purify and systematize?
