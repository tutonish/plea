# More Things Vivid with Self-Development

Vividness is that quality of a word which brings the things spoken of before the mind's eye with clearness, ease and lifelikeness. But in order that a word may do that it must appeal to the mind's old associates and impressions; it must *gather* for the hearer such particular images as he is acquainted with, and as he needs to build up the thought. *Oculist* is arbitrary, it appeals to nothing, gathers nothing. Thinking is gathering impressions. Therefore an arbitrary foreign word cannot be vivid. A mentally economical word is one that furnishes in itself the images out of which to construct the thought. Herbert Spencer says in his "Philosophy of Style:"

> As we do not think in generals but in particulars—as, whenever any class of things is referred to, we represent it to ourselves by calling to mind individual members of it—it follows that when an abstract word is used the hearer or reader has to choose from his stock of images, one or more, by which he may figure to himself the genus mentioned. In doing this some delay must arise, some force be expended; and if, by emplying a specific term an *appropriate image* can be at once suggested, an economy is achieved, and a more vivid impression produced.

By compounding the common words, we make language more figurative and picturesque. Prof. Marsh says, Lect. Eng. Lang., p. 200:

> Our present power of derivation and composition is much restricted, and while many other languages can change all nouns, substantives and adjectives into each other or into verbs, and *vice versa*, still retaining the *root form*, which makes the new-coined word at once understood by every native ear, we, on the contrary, are constantly obliged to resort to compounds of foreign, and to us, unmeaning roots, whenever we wish to express a complex idea by a single word. The German and other cognate language still retain this command over their hereditary resources, and in point of ready intelligibility and picturesqueness they have an important advantage over langauges which, like the Latin and its derivatives, possess less plastic power. There are in all Gothic tongues numerous compounds of very obvious etymology, which are not eminently expressive, considered as a part of what may be called the nature-speech of man, as contrasted with that which is more appropriately the dialect of literature and art, and thus those languages are rich just where, as I remarked in a former lecture, our own is growing poor.

> The vocabulary belonging to the affections, the terms descriptive of the spontaneous action of the intellectual and moral faculties, the *pictorial words which bring the material creation vividly before us*, these languages in question are all more numerous and forcible than Latin terms by which we have too often supplied their places. The facility of derivation and composition in Greek and Gothic languages is almost unlimited, and a native once master of the radicals (common words), and fully possessed of the laws of formation, can at any time extemporize a word for the *precise* expression of any complete idea he may choose to embody in a single vocable.

The Professor says the English is rich in the language of literature and art. A self-developed language is better for those branches, also, because in all cases it will be necessary to *understand, remember and feel*.

The Postmaster-General, Stephan, of Berlin has forbidden any foreign words to be used in the postal service, and ordered homogeneous German words to be substituted. The architects of Germany held lately a convention in which it was agreed to substitute homogeneous German words in the fine art of architecture. The "German Language Association" are constantly driving out what foreign words are still remaining, both in literature, science and art, because harmonious self-developed words are more understood, longer remembered, more definite, more vivid to high and low. In Germany they speak about men who have labored for language purification as benefactors of das Vaterland. Over the grave of the linguist Jakob Grimm is raised a beautiful monument. The Russians are beginning to follow the Germans in this respect. We shall soon hear of an agitation for the improvement of the Chinese language.
